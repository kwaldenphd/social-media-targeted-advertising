        "\n",
        "In her 2018 book *Algorithms of Oppression*, Safiya Umoja Noble highlights the \"algorithmically driven data failures that are specific to people of color and women,\" arguing these systems \"undescore the structural ways that racism and sexism are fundamental to what I have coined *algorithmic oppression*\" (4).\n",
        "\n",
        "Noble calls for \"all the voices to come to the fore and impact public policy on the most unregulated social experiment of our times: the Internet\" (6).\n",
        "\n",
        "Thinking about the chapters we read from *Algorithms of Oppression*....\n",
        "\n",
        "**Discussion questions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- What stood out to you from Chapter 1's opening story about the UN Women campaign?\n",
        "  * What connections can we make with the author’s broader framework of algorithmic oppression?\n",
        "\n",
        "- One of the arguments Noble makes in analyzing the UN Women campaign is how efforts to raise awareness often “reinforce the idea that it is not the search engine that is the problem but, rather, the users of search engines who are” (15). What connections can we make with conversations taking place about other social media platforms, in relation to content moderation, protected speech, etc.?\n",
        "\n",
        "- What stood out to you from Chapter 3's opening narrative about the 2015 massacre that took place at Charleston’s Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church?\n",
        "  *  connections can we make with the author’s broader framework of algorithmic oppression?\n",
        "\n",
        "- What connections can we make with race and surveillance? Or, where do we see race and surveillance at work?\n",
        "\n",
        "- What could it look like to push back on the framing of search results as a neutral, objective representation of reality? \n",
        "\n",
        "- How do we think more critically about whose interests are prioritized and/or promoted in the digital information landscape?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Other observations, comments, or questions from these chapters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quotes to consider from Chapter 1:\n",
        "\n",
        "- “What I find troubling is that the [UN Women] campaign also reinforces the idea that it is not the search engine that is the problem but, rather, the users of search engines who are. It suggests that what is most popular is simply what rises to the top of the pile. While serving as an important and disturbing critique of swexist attitudes, the campaign fails to implicate the algorithms or search engines that drive certain results to the top” (15-16)\n",
        "\n",
        "- “Our work...is about interrogating the many ways that data and computing have become so profoundly their own ‘truth’ that even in the face of evidence, the public still struggles to hold tech companies accountable for the products and errors of their ways. These errors increasingly lead to racial and gender profiling, misrepresentation, and even economic redlining” (27-28)\n",
        "\n",
        "- “I contend that there is work to be done to contextualize and reveal the many ways that Black women are embedded within the most popular commercial search engine--Google Search--and that this embeddedness warrants an exploration into the complexities of whether the content surfaced is a result of popularity, credibility, commerciality, or even a combination thereof” (63)\n",
        "\n",
        "Quotes to consider from Chapter 3:\n",
        "\n",
        "- “The provision of false information that purports to be credible news, and the devastating consequences that can come from this kind of algorithmically driven information, is an example of why we cannot afford to outsource and privatize uncurated information on the increasingly neoliberal, privatized web” (11)\n",
        "\n",
        "- “It is critical that we think about the implications of people who are attempting to vet information in the news media about race and race relations and who are led to fascist, conservative, anti-Black, anti-Jewish, and/or White supremacist websites. The power of search engines to lead people to a breadth and depth of information cannot be more powerfully illustrated than by looking at Dylann Roof’s own alleged words about using Google to find information about the Trayvon Martin murder, which led to his racial identity development” (115)\n",
        "\n",
        "- “What we find in search engines about people and culture is important. They oversimplify complex phenomena. They obscure any struggle over understanding, and they can mask history. Search results can reframe our thinking and deny us the ability to engage deeply with essential information and knowledge we need...Search results, in the context of commercial advertising companies, lay the groundwork...for implicit bias” (116)\n"

Voyant also offers <a href=\"https://github.com/sgsinclair/Voyant\">open-source code</a> that can be used to deploy the program on a server. Voyant users can upload text files from their computer, link to online text sources, or scrape the text off a webpage for analysis and visualization. Unlike more advanced, programming-oriented textual analysis programs like R and R Studio, Voyant gives users access to a range statistical analysis and visualization features without requiring significant technical knowledge.\n",
