The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but\nthey are wrong. We won\u2019t put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does\nnot talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it\nmention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some\noutdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a\nvictory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no.\nWe are free Citizens of Texas and we\u2019ve had enough of this Cheap show on\nthe screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and\ngun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but\nnot without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher\ntaxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist\nattacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let\u2019s remind them\nwhat Texas is made of and show that we\u2019re ready to SECEDE!\n\nUse our page to team up with other locals. Invite your friends and family,\nspread the word and let's make this effort together! Get Ready to Secedel\n\n",

Let them be your reasons, not influenced\nupon or manipulated in any way.\n\nI'm proud of this mama not because she didn't vote #Hillary or #Trump, but\n\nsimply because she did her research, decided for herself, in her interest and\nthe interest of her kids, and voted consciously!\n\nI'm glad i Choose not to be a part of this whole system.\nIm proud to be woke\n\n",

The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but\nthey are wrong. We won\u2019t put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does\nnot talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it\nmention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some\noutdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a\nvictory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no.\nWe are free Citizens of Texas and we\u2019ve had enough of this Cheap show on\nthe screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and\ngun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but\nnot without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher\ntaxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist\nattacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let\u2019s remind them\nwhat Texas is made of and show that we\u2019re ready to SECEDE!\n\nUse our page to team up with other locals. Invite your friends and family,\nspread the word and let's make this effort together! Get Ready to Secedel\n\n",

According to ex-cop\u2018s attorneys, their defendant acted in self-\ndefense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times,\nhitting Scott five times from behind.\n\nSlager\u2018s defense attorney\u2018s:\n\n\u201cThe doubIe-teaming of Slager is a chilling example of how far politically\nmotivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather\ntheir own nests at the expense of a public servant who had to make a split-\nsecond life or death decision that will be seoond-guessed by comfortable\narmchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.\u201d\n\nThe shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken\nbrake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager\u2018s\ndashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him\nabout documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott\njumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a\nbystander\u2018s video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire.\n\nWe\u2018ve seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead\nblack bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none\nof them found guilty. That\u2018s why today it\u2018s important to send a message to\nother police officers that if they do this, it\u2018s harsh penalty to pay.\n\n",

Oh\ngod! My back!\u201d\nIn a statement, released on November 2, Minneapolis Police Department\n\nconfirmed the arrest, but said that a fuller video would show that the officers\u2019\nconduct was justified.\n\n",

Two months\nbefore his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two\nsons.\n\nJoshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of\nhis cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in\nIndianapolis at the age of 26.\n\nBeal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what\nauthorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off-\nduty firefighter.\n\nThe relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest\nMemorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said.\n\nSuddenly, Boxley said, a car out her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old\nsister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her\noff \u2014 who she believed was a Chicago police officer \u2014 stopped and got out of\ntheir cars.\n\nAt some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a\ngun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley.\n\nShe said the man got inside his car but exited again and \u201che just started\nshooting,\u201d hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his\ngun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal\nlegally owned the gun and did not fire it.\n\nBoxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began\nshooting him.\n\n\u201cI was hoping my brother wasn\u2019t dead,\u201d said Boxley.\n\nBeal\u2019s mother said he was a father to two Children, a 4-year-old and a 2\u2014year-\nold, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother.\n\n\u201cThis is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They\nhave no consideration for life,\u201d - Tiffaney Boxley.\n\nYet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will\nsay, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own\ndeath, armed or unarmed.\n\n#joshuabeal #altonsterling #TerenceCrutCher #westandtogether\n#blacklivesmatter #unite4justice\n\n",

In the face of violence directed at minority communities and in a\ndeepening political divisions in the country, King\u2019s words and philosophy are\nperhaps more critical for us today than at any point in the recent past.\n\nWe\u2019re coming together on January 15 to celebrate the life and achievements\none of the most influential American Civil rights leaders. Don\u2019t forget to bring\nyour Children with you, because it\u2019s important for them to know where they\ncome from and their rich history.\n\nJoin us on January 15! Let\u2019s keep the dream alive! Martin Luther King Jr.\nRally\n\n",

The\n12-year-old was carrying a toy airsoft gun when officer Timothy Loehmann\nshot him within two seconds of arriving on the scene. A grand jury decided not\nindict the killer.\n\nTamir\u2019s mother said she is \u201cmad as hell\u201d with the grand jury\u2019s decision of\ndeclaring the officer not guilty. She went on to say, \u201cHe was my bright and\nshining star. He was full of light and laughter. Tamir had the potential to\nbecome anything in the World, but Officer Loehmann and Garmback didn\u2019t\ngive him a Chance\u201d.\n\nDue to the corrupt system, Samaria Rice has a dead Child.\n\nHowever; he will always live in our hearts. Join us on November 26 to honor\nthe memory of Tamir and show support to his family. Remember Tamir Rice\n\n",

The\n12-year-old was carrying a toy airsoft gun when officer Timothy Loehmann\nshot him within two seconds of arriving on the scene. A grand jury decided not\nindict the killer.\n\nTamir\u2019s mother said she is \u201cmad as hell\u201d with the grand jury\u2019s decision of\ndeclaring the officer not guilty. She went on to say, \u201cHe was my bright and\nshining star. He was full of light and laughter. Tamir had the potential to\nbecome anything in the World, but Officer Loehmann and Garmback didn\u2019t\ngive him a Chance\u201d.\n\nDue to the corrupt system, Samaria Rice has a dead Child.\n\nHowever; he will always live in our hearts. Join us on November 26 to honor\nthe memory of Tamir and show support to his family. Remember Tamir Rice\n\n",

The crime? Shoplifting. Mitchell, who had a severe mental illness had\nbeen ruled permanently disabled and was unable to work. In April, he stole a\nzebra cake, a Snickers, and Mountain Dew from a local 7-11 in Portsmouth,\nVirginia. It would be a month before he ever went before a judge.\n\nAjudge then ruled him incompetent to stand trial. He should have been\ntransported to a local mental health facility, but he wasn't. Apparently there\nwasn't one that had room for him. Three months later he was found dead in\nhis cell. No meds had ever been administered. He had never made it to a\nmental health facility. He had lost nearly 80 pounds because he refused to\neat. All for less than $5 worth of snacks he stole while in a mental health\ncrisis.\n\nYes, you can die over 5 dollars here in America. Nothing new here. Justice is\njust an empty word in this country. Be sure, you will never know the truth. We\nare far away from the truth.\n\n",

What a hypocrite!\n\nAnd she doesn't even perform the ceremony, only issue a license. What her\nreligious convictions has to do with it?? It's not up to her to make policy, it's\nher role only to enact it!\n\nFunny how all these \"Christians\" are preaching and practicing all this hate,\neh?\n\nIf Jesus were around today, his response would be most likely, \"What the hell\nis wrong with you people!\"\n\n#SameSexMarriage #MarriageEquality #Kentucky #SCOTUS #homophobia\n#bigotry\n\n",

Since then the US.\nConstitution has been amended twenty-seven times. All of amendments are\nsteps that made the United States the greatest country in the world.\n\nThe US. Constitution is not only the law, it is the basis of the country. Every\ntrue patriot respects it.\n\nUnfortunately, last decade has become the time of nihilism. More and more\npeople don\u2019t respect American law. More and more people come to the\nUnited States and some of them don\u2019t feel reverence for our Constitution. It\ngoes without saying that illegals who already broke the immigration law and\nwill violate the supreme law easily. But the worst thing is that the current\npresident of the United States and some high-ranking officials also spit upon\nthe Constitution. They call for ban the right to bear arms, a confederate flag (I\nthink this flag reflects not slavery, but important part of American history) and\nsome liberals ban even the Old Glory -- a school district in Tennessee has\nbanned all flags and banners, including the US. flag -- and so on. The same\nregards the lran deal.\n\nAmerica has a hard time. And we have to save the US. Constitution. We\nhave to do it in God\u2019s name! America has to be great again because we are\none nation under God!\n\n",

    "text": "Barack Obama and his team have spent two months working to secure 41\npercent for Iran deal. And now they Claim enourmous victory.\n\nUnder the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the\n\nSenate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect \u2014 a legally binding long-\nterm agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of\ndollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed.\n\nSince this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been\nobliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can\nnever get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in\n2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and\nthe Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama.\n\nBut Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to Change a\nsubject to a vote \u2014 not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be\ntreated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and\nthe Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his\npresidential veto.\n\nThe Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to\noverturn such a veto \u2014 and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So,\ninstead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67\nsenators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or\nmore Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to\nsupport the deal.\n\nThus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will\nsimply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking\nand obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42\npercent.\n\nBarack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn\u2019t care\nabout Americans. All what he cares is his outsized ambitions.\n\n",

He reveals his\nsexuality to female bounty hunter Jas Emari, who tries to Chat him up.\nChuck Wendig, author of Star Wars: Aftermath, said: \"I don\u2019t think his\nsexuality needs to be this giant plot point. At the same time, it\u2019s part of who\nhe is.\n\nIsn't that great, guys? Ain't no lie, It's a big step forward. We want to thank the\ncreators of the new \"Star Wars\" for the incredible courage and opposition to\nconservative bias in Hollywood Cinema. There should be a special\norganization in Hollywood that will protect the rights of gay actors. There\nshould be at least one gay Character in every movie in order to help the\nAmerican society get rid of homophobic stereotypes.\n\n",

He is now waiting for gender surgery.\n\nBishop Rafael Zornoza Boy of Cadiz and Ceuta rejected the family\u2019s request\nto name Salinas as a godfather. Then, after a media storm, the bishop wrote\nto the Vatican for advice.\n\nZornoza published the Vatican\u2019s reasoning for rejecting Salinas\u2019 wish.\n\nIt said transsexual behavior \u201creveals in a public way an attitude opposite to\nthe moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the\ntruth of one\u2019s own sexuality.\u201d\n\nThe pope supported gays, but now for some reason the transman wasn't\nallowed to be a godfather in Spain, an entirely Catholic, but at the same time,\nthe most friendly country towards the LGBT community. Anyway it's just\nanother superstition of Church. Funny.\n\n",

Had the situation been reversed,\nhowever, police officers would face neither criminal nor Civil prosecution for\ndeclining to aid a Citizen under assault by a suspect.\n\nA man named Devonte Conerly who was suspected in a hit and run incident,\nallegedly tried to disarm the police officer who stopped him. Several officers\nresponded to a call for assistance and eventually subdued and handcuffed\nConerly. They then rebuked several bystanders who had declined to\nintervene.\n\nBystanders are not liable to prosecution if the failure to render aid \u201cwas\nreasonable under the Circumstances,\u201d but the burden of demonstrating that\nthis is the case is placed upon the accused.\n\nWhen you'll see a bunch of cops beating an unarmed man, don't forget that\nyou can be in his place just for not helping cops in committing a crime.\n\n",

Police released the teen to the\ncustody of his mother rather than take him to the juvenile detention facility.\n\nPolice are trained to think like the military in combat, which means they\nprioritize their own safety and the safety of fellow officers over everything\nelse, including that of the citizens they allegedly \u201cprotect and serve.\u201d\n\n",

Of course, not all Americans have a gun, but\ncriminals don\u2019t know who is unarmed. Liberals can say that guns increase\ncrime rate. In fact, it is nonsense. Look at statistics: the most gun-friendly\nstate is Wyoming, and it has low crime-rate.\n\nThe states with high crime rate are states where there are many illegals as\nusual.

I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d On\nWednesday night, a white police officer in the small town of Stonewall,\nMississippi allegedly strangled Sanders, a 39-year-old black horseman, with a\nflashlight before killing him in view of his family members.\n\nOfficer Kevin Herrington pulled Sanders off a horse and choked him with a\nflashlight, Sander\u2019s attorney, Stewart Parrish, initially told an ABC affiliate.\nParrish |ater Clarified that those allegations came from family members who\nwitnessed the death. Parrish said that Sanders experienced \u201csome kind of\n\nasphyxiation\u201d during the altercation.\nSanders died on the scene and leaves behind two Children.\n\nThe last words of Eric garner were \"I can't breathe,\" the last words of\nJonathan Sanders were \"I can't breathe, let me go\". Biting irony, isn't it?\nSince when is it illegal to train your horse in Close propinquity to your house?\nAmerica was always (and it is now) a police state for black people.\n\n",

It was very touching and thought\nprovoking.\n\nShe spoke about her own personal experience so far as a transgender\nwoman. But she also dedicated a significant percentage of her speech to a\nthoughtful and touching discussion of the vast number of issues facing the\nlarger transgender community.\n\nIn her past life Caitlyn was known worldwide as a sports hero.

Authorities say a man was a practicing Muslim. At present FBI is\nconducting an investigation. According to his beliefs, Mohammad was a\nfundamental Islamist. Having examined after his death his social pages, FBI\nhas found that he kept a blog and had a note where he said that he\nconducted a terrorist act in obedience to Allah. It is notable that the terrorist\nattack was conducted in the last day of Ramadan. It is noteworthy that in his\nletter the terrorist didn\u2019t refer to ISIS or AI-Qaeda; he acted in his own\nvolition.\n\nWe don\u2019t want to stir up Islamophobia, but if such manifestations of Islam\nhave place, it is very sorrowful for the United States. The situation in the\nMiddle East and the extensive propaganda of ISIS make ordinary Muslims to\nbecome radical Islamists and take the path of war and death. If people on\ntheir own commit such attacks, the American society must take it more\nseriously. The society should develop a new behavioral model towards Islam,\naccording to which, on the one hand Muslims and Christians will live\ncomfortable together. And on the other hand, Muslims won\u2019t tend to radical\nactivities and the destruction of peaceful life of Americans.\n\n",

Officers sprayed him with oleoresin capsicum, more\ncommonly known as pepper spray, according to police. The Chemical agent\ndebilitates a person by causing temporary blindness and irritating a person's\nnose and throat.\n\nThe six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during\nan investigation, according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and\nbody camera footage of the incident would be released after that\ninvestigation.\n\nThis tragedy happen accidentally, and probably the police officers didn't wish\ndeath upon him, because they tried to give him first aid. However, the man is\ndead and there is no Chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever,\nbut the cops will remain on duty and get away with this murder. Is this\nacceptable?\n\nWe will know about he process of detention after the investigation is over.\nLet's wait and keep our eyes open. Black Lives Matter!\n\n",

JUST LET US EAT CAKE!\n\nWedding cake is back in the news with developments in both the Oregon and\nColorado bakery cases involving discrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation. In Oregon, judgment has been finalized against Sweet Cakes by\nMelissa, requiring Aaron and Melissa Klein to pay a $135,000 fine for refusing\nservice to a same-sex couple. Meanwhile, in Colorado, Jack Phillips of\nMasterpiece Cakeshop, is appealing the ruling against him for refusing to\nserve a same-sex couple.\n\nIn the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges,\nconservatives are eager to highlight Phillips and the Kleins as evidence that\nreligious freedom is under attack. In fact, they have actually invented a new\nClaim about how these bakers\u2019 \u201cfree speech\u201d is under attack and how\n\nthey\u2019re thus the real victims.\n\nThere's a simple solution. Since they won't agree to the conditions for having\na license to do business with the public, they shouldn't have a license to do\nbusiness with the public! This is not a free speech issue, it is an issue of\nAmerican law! They can speak about their bigotry and ignorance, not to\npractice it!\n\n",

President Obama hasn\u2019t ordered to lower\na flag, though a federal law states that the flag shall be flown at haIf-staff upon\nthe deaths of principal figures or the governor can lower the US flag in his or\nher state following the deaths of officials or members of the US Army. By\ncontrast, Obama ordered the flags to haIf-staff following on the same day that\nas the shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The flag was lowered\nto haIf-staff the day following the terrorist attack during the Boston marathon,\n\nthe shooting at the Washington Navy Yard and the following the death of\nNelson Mandela. But it hasn\u2019t yet been lowered in honor of the service\n\nmembers murdered in Tennessee.\n\nBy doing so Obama shows the highest degree of disrespect for the fallen\nsoldiers. It turns out that for him the soldiers as well as veterans do not\n\ndeserve any attention or respect. Soldiers are needed only when it is\nnecessary to send them to the next unknown operation. They considered as\nmeat. But in reality, they are our heroes! They were victims of a terrorist\nattack. They were victims of a man who at first won refugee status and then\ndecided to kill in the name of Allah.\n\nIn general during the Obama presidency the country was divided in many\nways: racism became more evident, the number of illegal immigrants, who do\n\nnot even bother to learn English, because it\u2019s enough to speak Spanish, has\nincreased.\n\n",

For instance, in West Baltimore, Ta-Nehisi was\ntrained not to go to the neighborhoods unless you know this place. He was\ntold that you cannot tolerate anybody attempting any physically violent threat\nto you. Moreover, his mom was feared that her Children would get arrested.\n\nWhat does it mean? Undoubtedly, black Americans were afraid of police,\nimproper procedure, injustice or what is worse, being killed by police officer.\nThat\u2018s why the nationwide furor over the growing number of unarmed black\nmen fatally shot by police officers has put the public on a new trend in\nAmerica. In fact, this new trend caused disproportionate number of unarmed\npeople of color killed by police.\n\nHow dangerous is to live in your area today?\n",

How retarded and/or brainwashed by\nFox News is one supposed to be to believe this is a coincidence? No way we\nare gonna buy such bullshit.\n\nThe weirdest thing about this specific case is that the suicide was committed\njust an hour after the arrest. Moreover, the woman was suspected of stealing\nsomeone\u2019s phone which is quite not a reason for getting to her account.\nWe've got to also take into consideration that 1 in 3 black men go to prison as\nopposed to a considerably lower rate with the white men (http://www.alternet.\norg/story/154587/1 in 3 blaok_men_go_to_prison_the_10_most_disturbing_\n\nfacts_about_racia|_inequality_in the_u.s._criminal_justice_system).\n\nIt definitely seems like there\u2019s more to this since until recently taking into\ncustody hasn\u2019t been a reason for suicide among black women. Now for some\npeople the only way to deal with police violence at the police stations is simply\nkilling themselves...\n\n",

    "text": "Amandla Stenberg: Black Female Bodies Are Treated As Less Than Human\n\n\u201cDo black females lives matter, too?\u201d\n\nThat's the big question 16-year-old Amandla Stenberg posed on Instagram on\nSunday. The powerful post broke down the cultural double standards that\nplague black women every day.\n\n\u201cBlack features are beautiful, black women are hot,\u201d Stenberg wrote. \u201cWhite\nwomen are paragons of virtue and desire, black women are objects of\nfetishism and brutality. This, at least, seems to be the mentality surrounding\nblack femininity and beauty in a society built upon eurocentric beauty\nstandards.\u201d\n\nEverybody knows that racism is alive and prospering in America. However, all\nthe news about killing black men and black teenagers, police brutality, unfair\nsentences and other issues, distract us from the fact that black women are\nbeing abused in the most violent ways. Usually they can't stand up for\nthemselves unlike men, so they endure and suffer.\n\nIn modern America black women experience more depression than probably\nduring slavery, when everything was obvious, but now racism is hidden\nbehind the mask of tolerance.\n\n",

We loose our history! The gays, lesbians and\ntrans-sexuals have more rights now then other folks. They bring pervert\nculture in our houses as something normal. Today, LGBT community has\nturned into the head and everyone else is the tail.\n\nWe inherit the history, we make it, and we are fated to become part of it. What\nkind of inheritage next generation will get? The rainbow flag that is offensive\nand a symbol of hate. Instead of delete a big part of our history, can we ban\nthe rainbow from public display?\n\n",

The US. refugee admissions database wrapsnet.org\nstates that 437,829 new refugees came to the USA since Obama first took\noffice. Most of them were placed in Texas (46,351), California (44,162) and\nNew York (26,293). Many of refugees were placed in Ohio (14,855), Florida\n(21,613), Virginia (9,395), Colorado (11,300) and Nevada (3,421).\n\nSuch active provision of a shelter for refugees sooner or later will lead to the\nfact that the number of terrorist attacks in the USA will increase. The US\nHomeland Security Committee considers that the administration is admitting\ntoo many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps\nnew terrorist attacks won\u2019t be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more\nterrorist attacks if the immigration policy won\u2019t be tightened.\n\nWe have a lot of problems that require an active response and decisions from\nthe government: poverty, the problems of veterans, homelessness, racism,\nlaw enforcement system and so on. Is it possible to offer a better life for\nrefugees if not all US Citizens live normally?\n\n",

There were also many anti-racism supporters of other races.\nThe main problem is hatred which is spread among our society. The\ngovernment does nothing to solve the matter.

While the\nfamily was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their\nown driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the\ndriveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family.\n\n\u201cHe slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a\ngun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn\u2019t worth anything now,\u201d\nMark Wilson said.\n\nWhen one spits upon the law because he thinks that it\u2019s amoral, it is\nbeginning a chaos. Liberals want to ban a confederate flag because slavery\nwas in the 18th and 19th centuries. They don\u2019t want to understand that\nslavery was legal in many countries of the world, but nobody wants to ban a\nflag of England or France.\n\nActivists and groups like the NAACP are also calling for statues and\nmonuments to Confederate leaders to be demolished, including the carving at\nStone Mountain, the largest bas relief sculpture in the world. Some are even\ndemanding that Washington, DC be renamed in the name of political\ncorrectness because George Washington owned slaves.\n\nLiberals actually want to destroy American history and culture. Americans\nshould be guided by the law, because sometimes moral is not Clear. If\nsomebody thinks that the Democratic party is amoral, nobody demands to\neliminate the party.\n\nContinue to stay for the First amendment! Let\u2019s stop the Chaos!\n",

    "text": "Teen shot by St. Louis police paralyzed; mom laments gun violence\n\nA teenager shot by City police is paralyzed below the waist, his mother said\nSunday as her family copes with another episode of gun violence. Not seven\nyears ago, her teenage daughter was accidentally shot to death.\n\nThis time, a firearm in the hand of her son, Brandon Claxton, 16, prompted an\nofficer to shoot him three times about 7:15 pm. Saturday in a housing\ncomplex in the 2500 block of Hodiamont Avenue, officials said. Police\nencountered him while responding to a call about someone with a stolen\npistol.\n\nHis mother said that she respected the police and that her son \u201cshouldn\u2019t\nhave had the gun.\u201d But from what witnesses have told her, she said, \u201cThey\ndidn\u2019t have to shoot him down like that.\u201d\n\nOne of three witnesses interviewed Sunday told a reporter that Brandon did\nhave a gun in his hand. But all three said that he did not point a weapon at\nanyone as he tried to run from officers.\n\nWhen a white guy walks around with a rifle, nobody bats an eye. When a\nblack guy walks with a pistol (or even a toy gun) - he'll be immediately shot by\nthe police. Have you ever heard about open carry in the United States? Then\nhere we go. Racial prejudice at its finest.\n\nOur condolences to the family.\n",

The\nfigure from the Census Bureau is a calculation of net migration\u2014meaning the\ntotal number of immigrants who will arrive in the United States in 2015 would\nactually be larger than 1.24 million.\n\nOf course, the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had\nhuge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage, today\nthere is a jobs deficit. Today the government must restrict immigration that is\na reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate\nfuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low\nwages. So, besides social problem, immigrants threaten the US. economy.\nThose who work illegaly don\u2019t pay taxes that are an important part of state\n\nbudget. Working illegaly, they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions\nincreases crime rates.\n\nMoreover, more and more immigrants cannot speak English. One-fifth of\npeople in the United States speak a foreign language at home, according to a\nreport of the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nYou see, increasing ammount of immigrants in the United States creates\nsocial and economic problems. However, we have a risk not only to worsen\nthe US. economy, but also to lose our culture. America can\u2019t be the Tower of\nBabel, we cannot allow everybody to live here if immigration threatens us. We\ndon\u2019t hate foreigners, we are glad to see tourists from every corner of the\nworld, but we cannot allow them to stay here.\n\nIt\u2019s the bathos of stupidity to stimulate immigration when it creates enormous\nproblems for the nation.\n\n",

When they returned, they had a\nflurry of phone messages from the mother, crying and urging them to get back\nsoon. A nurse had been questioning her about her decision to let a gay\ncouple adopt her baby.\n\n\u201dAren\u2019t you afraid those boys are gonna hurt that baby? Aren\u2019t you afraid\n\nthat he\u2019s not gonna grow up and be normal?\u201d asked the nurse.\n\nExcuse me who the hell is she?! This bigot is forcing her views onto the\nmother, because she doesn't think the baby would grow up \"normal\"? A\nmother who's making the difficult decision to place her son up for adoption,\nand a wonderful couple who wants to raise that child. What the hell right does\nthe nurse have to try to stop that? I hope they fire her.\n\nI'm happy for the Gay couple on becoming parents!\n",

Well, then how come Detroit is no less\ndangerous then (the City ranks third in the list of top 100 US most dangerous\nCities)??\n\nWhen 24-year-old DaJuawn Wallace saw flashing blue police lights in his\nrearview mirror he Chose to proceed with caution since some people are\nknown to be robbed by fake police officers. He preferred to find a we||-|it area\nto pull over in. As a result, he was Charged with \u2018fleeing\u2019 police.\n\nPeople are terrified by the police to such a degree that they even prefer to\ncommunicate with officers only in the we||-|it areas. And get Charged for that.\nSometimes it makes me actually think that when not involved in any military\noperations in the foreign countries, our country\u2019s at war with its own Citizens\nwith the help of police.\n\n",

He has been\ndiscriminated against by local authorities in Louisville, Ky.\n\nThere's a gap between Kentucky law and federal law. People trying to Change\nthe gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery.\n\nBut many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical\nreasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these\npeople\u2019s Circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats.\n\nIt is very important for every transgender to be able to Change his\\her\nidentification to reflect who they really are. It\u2019s not just about person dressed\nas a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is\nabout much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man\nor woman on|y presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they\nwere assigned to at birth.\n\nTransgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification\nChanges. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible.\nBecause it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you\nwere assigned to at birth.\n\nPlease share your stories with us, because united we can stand against\ninjustice and inequality!\n\n#Kentucky #transgender #inequality #discrimination\n",

Shane is the first\n\nopenly trans soldier of the US Army.\n\nHe\u2019s astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (Check out his\nmuscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee,\nhe's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he\ngets giddy talking about both video games and shopping wood in Alaska.\n\nYet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has\nbeen at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army\npaperwork, he is identified as a woman.\n\nBut the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for\nthe transgender people in the military. And he succeeded!\n\nAmerica's military progressing s|ow|y towards inclusion and equal opportunity.\nLet\u2019s hope that these changes\u201c ensure peace, instead of waging more war.\n\n#Igbt #transgender #equality #usarmy #Ortega\n",

The\nsystem needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department,\nthe biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or\ndisorderly conduct.\n\nThe New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit\nwith summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what\nshould we do?\n\nThe criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be Changed. The worse, it\nis now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep\npeople in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a\nbusiness.\n\nThe first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government\nwill start to sell indulgences soon.\n\nOur system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative\nsolutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and\npotentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail!\n\nLemme ask you, have you ever seen a one of the tobacco industry executives\ngo to jail? I guess no. We also have never seen the Bush or any other\nPresidents administrations were brought to justice.\n\nAmerica has a justice system that was supplanted the Jim Crow laws as a\nmeans to keep the minorities from developing real opportunities for keeping\nthe very rich from ever being brought to justice.\n\n",

Why the police was not aware\nof a large party? Why this story has no national outrage? Is it ok when a black\nteenager dies?\n\nUnfortunately, the responding police officers were not able to prevent the\ntragedy.

He believed in Fight and Speaking the Truth.\n\nNowadays a lot of singers, both black and white use their music to sell\nrecords, just for making money. American society at all levels became too\ncorruptive, starting from our government and ending with ordinary Citizens. On\nthe contrary Tupac did his music to influence the world. That\u2019s why he spoke\nto issues of poverty, oppression and racism.\n\nToday young African-Americans have fallen under bad influence of money,\ndrugs and so on. Yeah, it is all started from the government\u2019s attitude\ntowards Blacks. But let\u2019s remember Tupac and his ability to question the\nsocial order. Changes, one of his popular songs, asks everyone to Change\ntheir lifestyles for better society. He always asked people to share with each\nother and to learn to love each other.\n\n",

Schlax has been working with\nCleve Jones, a human rights activist, who was mentored by Harvey Milk.\n\nIt is proposed that the Class will begin in autumn. Really perfect idea! There\nare at least twenty eight percent of LGBT students in Asawa High School. It is\nthe fact that we need such Classes in every American school! Children\nshouldn\u2019t be afraid to show who they are; they shouldn\u2019t be afraid to speak\nabout LGBT history; they should know that it is normal to be gay or lesbian or\ntransgender. Everybody should be taught to understand LGBT people and\nrecognize them as ordinary Citizens.\n\n",

Let\u2019s take a look at just how crazy\nthis pledge gets.\n\nThat\u2019s just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional\namendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last\ndecade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55\npercent!\n\nBut they don\u2019t stop there. NOM also wants candidates to \u201cwork to overturn\nany Supreme Court decision\u201d in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants\nthe president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at\nthis point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that\nsupporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn\u2019t qualified to be a judge.\n\nAlso, NOM wants the candidates to weaken Civil rights laws, creating\nloopholes to let companies and Citizens to discriminate if they Cite a religious\njustification. That could actually happen \u2014 and it already has in some states \u2014\nso it\u2019s a huge concern.\n\nAnd fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment\nagainst people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are\nharassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated\nfrom theirfamilies, but I really hope soon there\u2019ll be NO MORE of it!\n\nThere\u2019s a part of me that feels very sad for NOM\u2019s fanatics. When they\nfinally kick the bucket, they\u2019ll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly\nface it or not) that their Life\u2019s Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they\nworked for made anyone\u2019s life better. At all.\n\nThey didn\u2019t win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable.\nAnd when they\u2019re dead and gone, they\u2019ll be remembered only as footnotes\nin shameful history \u2014 or more likely they \u2018ll be forgotten completely.\n\n#LGBT #NOM #SameSexMarriage #Marriage #SCOTUS #equality\n",

Why should we give a Citizenship to those who\ncannot give something good for the nation?\n\nThe worst thing is that illegal immigrants who broke the law to live in the\nUnited States demand ask for indulgences. What nonsense! Illegals should\nbe deported from the country invariably.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s administration is tied to the chariot of immigrants. Democrats\nknow that immigrants will vote for the Democratic party. Especially former\nillegals. That\u2019s why Barack Obama tries to give the Immigration Amnesty to\nillegals as soon as possible. It will allow to increase a number of votes for a\nDemocratic Party presidential candidate in 2016.\n\nAnd democrats don\u2019t care about the fact that most of immigrants will become\nwelfare recipients, increasing unemployment rate. America doesn\u2019t need\nimmigrants, democrats do. What\u2019s more important: to win Presidential\nelections in 2016 or to make America better? Democrats seem to Choose first\noption. That\u2019s what differs republicans from democrats.\n\n",

Since January 1,\n2015 at least 508 people have now been killed by policemen. Moreover,\nanalyzing all deaths caused by police, African-Amerioan and Hispanic people\nare more likely to be killed than Whites. Figures show that the index of deaths\nfor black people is 3.45 per million, while for whites it is 1.26 per million. Add\nhere military-style equipment and non-lethal weapons, given to cops.\n\nAnd only 0.02 per cent of the nation\u2019s police forces are investigated each\nyear. Only 0.02! That means, US policemen are immune from criminal\nChanges in their killings. That\u2019s why they carry out their daily police raids to\ndestroy the population at the territories under their control.\n\n",

According to the\nfamily\u2018s testimony, Krystal Dixon and her sister Maya Dixon took their eight\nChildren, nephews and nieces to Ohio public school in a Fairfield.\nNevertheless, the pool employee demanded the family to leave due to one of\nthe Children did not have swim trunks. One of the boys broke the rules and\nthe staff asked the family to leave. As six-months pregnant Krystal Dixon\nwalked to the parking lot, the police officer grabbed her arm and asked for an\nID-oard. The witness video shows how the police officer pepper sprayed\nDixon\u2018s family and grabbed 12-year-old Child by neck. But according to the\nFairfield police department, the white police officer did not use excessive\nforce.\n\nDid the pool staff force them to leave because they were black? Was it a race\nfactor? Don\u2018t you think the police officer\u2018s attempt to arrest Krystal Dixon was\nunlawful? How the police officers should be Charged? What kind of right of\ndefense do you have against unlawful arrests?\n\nThese days, there is far more to being a \u201cgood cop\u201d than Choosing not to hurt\ninnocent people. Plus, when are we going to stop being stereotypical? Even\ntoday, the stereotypes effect black population of the United States of America\ntransmitted through music, lyrics, titles, literature, movies and folk saying.\nWhite Americans across the country embrace African-Americans the image of\ncriminals and |ooters. How are we going to live with that?\n\n",

The young Clean-shaved\nshooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people.\nCharleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be\ninvestigated as hate crime.\n\nEmanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American Church which was\nfound by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822.\n\nDespite the first black American president, Africa-Amerioans remain the most\ncommon victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to\nxenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage\nthat is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms\ntake another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we\nthink it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for\nIslamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last\nFebruary American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from\nthe University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate\nand intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-Crimes?\n\nWhat if American racial Change sti|| occurs through generations? What of it\nracism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a\ndeeply racist country? What if the Church is not a safe place anymore?\n\n#CharlestonShooting #Chsnews\n",

Both parents of Rachel Dolezal are white. Rachel Dolezal also\nserves as the Chair of Spokane's Office of Police Ombudsman Commission\nand is an adjunct professor of Africana Studies at Eastern Washington\nUniversity. Dolezal falsely identified herself as African-American in order to be\nappointed as a Chair. Dolezal's parents paid attention to the official\ndocuments, including a birth certificate, confirming that Rachel is part\nSwedish, Czech, and German with \"traces\" of Native American heritage.\n\nWe see, how whites are trying to gain control over traditionally black\norganization that protects the rights and interests of the black community. In\nthe Dolezal\u2019s case it is unlikely it was a mistake or personally motivated\nfraud. Simply she was given a task to join the association of black community\nin order to control it and hold the interests of white majority.\n\nWe need a deep inspection of Rachel Dolezal\u2019s activities while she was a\npresident of the local branch of the Association of black people! In order not to\nrepeat similar cases in future we need a careful control of all appointments by\nblack community! As it is, there is a dominance of whites in police\ndepartments and authorities of Cities with a predominantly black population!\n\n",

I\u2019m sure their parents are just as\nguilty for not knowing what their kids were doing; or knew it and didn\u2019t care,\u201d\nshe wrote. She also added,\u201c|\u2019m almost to the point of wanting them all\nsegregated on one side of town so they can hurt each other and leave the\ninnocent people alone. Maybe the 50s and 60s were really on to something.\nNow, let the bashing of my true and honest opinion begin... .GO! #imnotraoist\n#imsickofthemcausingtrouble #itwasagatedcommunity\u201d.\n\nAs we see Karen Fitzgibbons is a real racist, who approves the humiliation of\nblack people! This news Clearly reflects that American society is Close to\ncollapse, if not to say to war. As the authorities are doing nothing to resolve\nthe situation, in the near future we may face rea| race war within our country.\n\n",

Witnesses reported that the cop tried to force them to\ndelete videos from their phones. Videos show how the Child writhes in agony\nfrom being tased. Police said that the Child ran away from home and was\nmissing for a day-and-half. However it doesn\u2019t give the reason to taser a\n\nchild.\n\nWe see another case of police misconduct, when the policeman actually\nattacked the Child. This case should reach the court, because the Child hasn\u2019t\ndone anything unlawful. The policeman exceeded his powers and used force\nagainst a Child. So he should be punished. Before the trial nothing's gonna\nChange and cops are about to do whatever they want. The task of all\nAmericans who have witnessed police brutality is to extend all the information\nabout it in order to reach out the government and the court.\n\n",

Like really? When\npolice took Gray to the hospital, doctors determined that he had sustained a\nsevered spine and crushed voice box. High-energy injury? We don't think so.\nIt's hard to believe. Do they think we're idiots or something?\n\nCops imprison you, shoot you, sever your spine, crush your larynx, send you\nto war, keep you poor, call you a thug and get away with it. There's no excuse\nfor what happened to Freddie.\n\n",

The young Clean-shaved\nshooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people.\nCharleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be\ninvestigated as hate crime.\n\nEmanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American Church which was\nfound by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822.\n\nDespite the first black American president, Africa-Amerioans remain the most\ncommon victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to\nxenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage\nthat is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms\ntake another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we\nthink it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for\nIslamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last\nFebruary American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from\nthe University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate\nand intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-Crimes?\n\nWhat if American racial Change sti|| occurs through generations? What of it\nracism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a\ndeeply racist country? What if the Church is not a safe place anymore?\n\n",

Police said that Mercedes and Josh knew each other, but it is not\nClear if Vallum knew Williamson was a transgender. Jeanie Miller, whom\n\nWilliamson had been living with, said that Vallum knew that Williamson was\ntransgender.\n\nModern America is too dangerous for transgenders. This is the ninth\ntransgender killing based on gender identity. According to the National\nCoalition of Ahti-Violence Programs\u2019 report hate-motivated violence against\ntransgenders rose 13%. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to live as a\ntransgender in the South. Alabama even passed a religious freedom law in\n1998 that allows discrimination against LGBT people. That also allows\nlawmakers to justify hostility toward transgender people. And that we call\n\u2018freedom\u2019? America is no longer land of freedom!\n\n",

It\u2019s only coming and the consequences will be\ndestructive if Hillary Clinton, the main hardliner against oops, will become the\nPresident of the United States.\n\nDefending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of\nevery American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American\nnational identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments\nliberal elites are constantly setting up on the country.\n\nDemocrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist\nmovements like Black Lives Matter. The Nation must unite against reverse\nracism, against those who want to destroy America!\n\nAmong all the candidates Donald Trump is the one and only who can defend\nthe police from terrorists.\n\n",

    "text": "Fellow Texans! It's time to say a strong NO to the establishment robbers. It is\nunacceptable for us to see them ruin all we've been building for decades. For\ncenturies. The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but\nthey are wrong. We won\u2019t put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does\nnot talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it\nmention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some\noutdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a\nvictory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no.\nWe are free citizens of Texas and we\u2019ve had enough of this Cheap show on\nthe screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and\ngun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but\nnot without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher\ntaxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist\nattacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let\u2019s remind them\nwhat Texas is made of and show that we\u2019re ready to SECEDE!\n\nUse our page to team up with other locals. Invite your friends and family,\nspread the word and let's make this effort together! Get Ready to Secede!\n\n",

There's always\nwas a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be\n\nfollowed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need\nof swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would\nbe exposed to, and of their need of protection.\n\nAnd we, American Christians, should remember about it.

And here are\nsome real Clinton decisions:\n\n\u2014Last year, Clinton Claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had\nbeen exaggerated by Republicans.\n\n\u2014In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007\nsupplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans\u2019\n\nmedical care.\n-In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20\n\nmillion for veterans\u2019 health care facilities.\n-In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for \u201c$13 billion\nfor veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the\npoor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the\nissue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they\nneed so bad!\n\nHardly will she Change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a\ndirect threat to the American veterans\u2019 society, but still practically no one\nraises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!\n\n",

And here are\n\nsome real Clinton decisions:\n\n\u2014Last year, Clinton Claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had\n\nbeen exaggerated by Republicans.\n\u2014In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007\nsupplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans\u2019\n\nmedical care.\n-In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20\n\nmillion for veterans\u2019 health care facilities.\n-In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for \u201c$13 billion\nfor veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the\npoor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the\nissue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they\nneed so bad!\n\nHardly will she Change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a\ndirect threat to the American veterans\u2019 society, but still practically no one\nraises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!\n\n",

October 22nd is a day that people\naround the nation have mobilized every year since 1996 for a National Day of\nProtest to Stop Police Brutality, Repression and the Criminalization of a\nGeneration.\n\nHere in Charlotte, this problem appears especially hard. A number of victims\nand quantity of cases, where justice wasn't served - horrifies. The most well-\nknown case is shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed black man who was\nshot ten times and killed. Or situation with Daniel Kevin Harris, a deaf man,\nwho just couldn't explain a thing, before he was shot.\n\nWe need to use our right to protest to demand the authorities and police\nrepresentatives, to do, the thing they are supposed to do! To protect and\nserve! Not to kill, damage and cripple!\n\nJoin us on October 22, in Charlotte, 600 East Trade Street, just between\nCharlotte City hall and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department.

She went on to say, \u201cHe was my bright and\nshining star. He was full of light and laughter. Tamir had the potential to\nbecome anything in the World, but Officer Loehmann and Garmback didn\u2019t\ngive him a Chance\u201d.\n\nDue to the corrupt system, Samaria Rice has a dead Child.\n\nHowever; he will always live in our hearts.

They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and Challenge\npolice brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the\ngovernment and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party\n\"the greatest threat to the internal security of the country\". They tried to Close\nit, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was\ndissolved.\n\n50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country\nstills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. lt spreads through all the country\nlike the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We\nneed a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that\ncan make Black Lives really matter.\n\nLet's get together and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the party that has\nmade the Change. Let's honor its founders and participants. Let's share their\nideas and ideals! Black Panther Party 50th Anniversary\n\n",

Just over a week before his\ndeath, he posted that he doesn't want to die too young on Twitter.\n\nOfficers responded to a burglary call around 1 am. on Friday, hearing reports\nthat a suspect was damaging vehicles. First spotting Taylor moving about the\nlot, officers also noticed Taylor's SUV had been smashed into the front of the\ndealership showroom. Finding that Taylor had moved inside the showroom,\nArlington Police Chief Police Will Johnson said Taylor would not comply when\ntold to lie down on the ground, but fled to a back room. 49-year-old officer\nBrad Miller entered the showroom to arrest Taylor, and then an altercation\nbroke out. Miller fired four shots, including the fatal bullets from the gun of\nMiller. A second officer fired a taser, Johnson said.\n\nAnd now there are three main points that you should think of:\n\n1) Taylor was described as a good kid. He was a football player at Angelo\nState University. Never was involved in criminal activities.\n\n2) The officer graduated from the police academy less than 6 months ago and\nwas working under the supervision of a training officer.\n\n3) Taylor didn't want to die young.\n\nBlack teens don't really live, they survive. And, unfortunately, there is no one\n\nto save them from death. There is no one to stop police brutality. We all want\nour kids to feel safe, we want them to be safe and sound. Are our hopes\n\ndoomed to disappointment?\n",

Therefore it endangers\nthe rights of black community.\n\nDoubtless when the government defends the officers who have killed black\nmen, it strikes us how unfair the system is and reaffirms our view that America\nwould spend billions of dollars on radical extremists than talking about the\ndomestic terrorism, racial inequality and police brutality.\n\n",

Being one of the 17 Children of\nformer slaves she was the first and the only Child to go to African-Amerioan\nschool. She found the Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute for Negro Girls\nbecause she believed that education was the key to racial advancement. In\naddition, Bethune did a lot of work to contribute to American society. For\ninstance, she was the president of the Florida Chapter of the National\nAssociation of Colored Women. Moreover, in 1935 Mary Bethune became an\nadvisory to President Roosevelt on minority affairs and later on she started\nher Civil rights organization, the National Council of Negro Women.\n\nThe great educator and Civil right activist Mary McLeod Bethune\ndemonstrated the values of education, the philosophy of love and the wise\nuse of power. Sadly, at least 10 years of data reveals that Congress don\u2018t pay\nattention to American Civil rights as Mary McLeod Bethune did 80 years ago.\n\n",

We\u2019re very\nmodern.\u201d\n\nWhen the Westboro Baptist announced its intentions to picket his funeral, pro-\nLGBT organisation Planting Peace raised over $40,000 for St. Jude\nChildren\u2019s Research Hospital \u2014 one of Williams\u2019 favourite Charities.\n\nRobin Williams played many different roles in so many people\u2019s lives, and\ngiving back to others was at the top of that list... We will never forget you. And\nwe'll always love you...\n\n",

A\ncopy of the alert said that the wife of a US. military member was approached\nin front of her home in Colorado by two men. The incident took place in May.\nSimilar incidents in Wyoming repeated in June.\n\nWe see that the threat of possible ISIS attack on families of the US. military\nhas risen. And when the threat is so real the US intelligence agencies are\ndoing nothing. As a matter of the fact they don\u2019t fully perform their duties.\nFirst of all, the US security forces should take all appropriate measures to\nidentify people who scour after the wives and Children of the US. Military.\nSecondly, families of the US. Military should be taken under special\nprotection of the police and the FBI. If even one hair of the US. Military family\nmembers will be lost then the work of American secret services isn\u2019t worth a\ndime as they cannot maintain security on the American soil. In case of a\nnegative scenario there won\u2019t be any need in their work. And this will be the\nfinal nail in the coffin of the American secret services.\n\nLet\u2019s remember the last FBI and NSA failures, such as failure to stop the\nBoston Marathon Bombings and so on.

St. Louis police fatally shot a black teenager while trying\nto issue search warrant\n\nOn Wednesday, Aug. 19 racial tensions again sparked in Missouri City after\nSt. Louis police officers fatally shot black teenager at Walton Avenue and\nPage Boulevard while trying to issue search warrant. According to St. Louis\nPolice Chief San Dotson, a young black man pointed a gun at officers and\nwas trying to escape from a house where officers were carrying out a search\nwarrant for him. The 33-year-old and 20-year-old officers who shot the\nsuspect four times were about seven years on the force.\n\nThat was followed by crowd of 150 people who gathered by intersection. Later\non, nine people were arrested on Charges of resisting arrest. The protesters\nsaid that the police provoked the situation. What do you think about it? What if\nthis situation makes us want to keep the police out of our neighborhood? Why\ndo you think police shoots first and then asks questions? Do you realize that\nthe shooting came just ten days after St. Louis was flooded with protesters\nwho were marking the anniversary of Michael Brown? What if the City and the\ngovernment needs to center its attention on racism and discrimination in\nAmerica instead of suspecting every single black men?\n\nWe cannot accept the fact that police can easily kill black people in America,\nthan we must do something about it. Protest or accept it. You Choose. This is\nyour life.\n\n",

Follow the rules and\nthe \"miracle\" won't be late in arriving.\n\nI bet you remember the white former officer who shot and killed an unarmed\nblack teen in Ferguson, last August? After national debate over the\nrelationship between police and black communities Darren Wilson aka \"Bad\ncop, who killed innocent black Child\" tried to go back to police work but was\nturned down because he's too big a liability.\n\nIn the recent interview to New Yorker magazine he said, \"It's too hot an issue,\nso it makes me unemployable.\"\n\nSo what does the situation mean to America?\n\nAlmost nothing except one thing... a man's life may be ruined because he had\nthe audacity to defend himself against huge man with malicious intent.\nMichael Brown was a thug, who had just assaulted a store owner, and robbed\nhim. Do you have any idea what should police officer do in such situation? He\nmust stop the criminal, period. He was in a no-win situation and it proves how\nupside-down society has become.\n\nI wonder, what will be the next step of American justice degradation? Will\nsurgeons be fired for operate patients with knives? Will Supreme Court send\nteachers to jail for teaching?\n\nInstead hate Wilson, we should pray for him. He did nothing wrong but idiots\nturned society against an innocent man. So is it a new America?\n\n",

The vast majority of\nthese combat vets served in Afghanistan and Iraq. About 19,000 of them have\nbeen pending one month and five years and about 16,000 have been pending\nfor more than five years. It is known that after five years vets lose their\neligibility for free health care. Moreover approx. one-third of 847,000 vets with\npending applications for health care had already died.\n\nWell, this story Clearly demonstrates what value for the state the life of a man\nwilling to sacrifice means. In fact the government doesn\u2019t care about its\nsoldiers, even if they are heroes. This confirms that the government\u2019s\nslapdash attitude to the recording vets system left more than 35,000 veterans\nwithout medical assistance. And how many of them died before the error in\nthe database was revealed! A truly disgusting attitude to our soldiers!\n\n",

Black Americans often complaint\nabout being pulled over for the phenomenon called \u201cdriving while black\u201d. For\nexample, a rich African American driving new Ferrari can be stopped\nhundreds of times for no apparent reason just because the fact that a black\nman driving an expensive car attract the attention of the police officers.\n\nBut what if racial profiling ends with lethal consequences? Do you remember\nSandra Bland who had run-ins with the police while driving? Do you all\nremember that she was found dead in police custody? Do we all have to\navoid traffic stops in order to survive?\n\nFor the matter of fact, the routine traffic stops are being a big deal for the\npeople of color. According to the Justice Department statistics, black drivers\nare about 31 percent more likely to be subject to police than whites. Overall,\nthis number indicates the racial difference in America.\n\n",

A Maryland town several weeks ago fired its first\nblack Police Chief, now exposing a racial rift\n\nThe leaders of small Maryland\u2018s City in Eastern Shore fired the Pocomoke\nCity\u2018s first black police Chief Kelvin Sewell due to his incompetence and\nrefusal to fire black police officers Franklin Savage and Lynell Green. Chief\nSewell was hired by Pocomoke City back in 2010 after his retirement from the\nBaltimore Police Department. Earlier, before Sewell\u2018s dismissal he filed a\ncomplaint on unequal employment opportunities Claiming he was paid less\nthan his white predecessors.\n\nThis is Circumstantial evidence that America is divided into different parts\nbased on race and income. Racism has gotten so bad, black people are\ntreated unfairly. If God created us equally, why the unequal treatment of\nminorities still exists in our country? What if the firing gas stirred a new spirit\nof African-American activism?\n\n",

I\u2019m gay.\u201d For many\nparents first reaction probably will be \u201cHow will I ever handle this?\u201d The\nanswer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help\nto understand your Child\u2019s sexuality and its meaning to you and your\ncontinued relationship with your son or daughter.\n\nSome parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their\nChild\u2019s sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as\nproblem-free \u2014 overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during\nthat time.\n\nSometimes parents try to deny what is happening \u2014 by rejecting what they're\nhearing (\u201cIt\u2019s just a phase; you\u2019ll get over it\u201d); by shutting down (\u201cIf you\nChoose that lifestyle, I don\u2019t want to hear about it\u201d); or by not registering the\nimpact of what we\u2019re being told (\u201cThat\u2019s nice, dear, and what do you want\n\nfor dinner?\u201d).\n\nSuch denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT Children. If\nyou as a parent 'll pretend to forgot the truth about your child\u2019s sexuality, you\nwould never really know your Child. A large part of his or her life would be kept\nsecret from you, and you would never really know the whole person.\n\nIt is important to accept and understand your child\u2019s sexuality because\nhomosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment\nfor some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of\ntelling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through \"a phase\".\n\nOn the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding\nand acknowledging his or her sexual orientation.

He was Charged with involuntary\nmanslaughter and two lesser Charges in her death, but the case was dropped\n\nin January 2015.\n\nJustice hasn\u2019t been served for Aiyana and her grieving family.\n\nWe\u2019re planning a peaceful rally in front of the Coleman A. Young Municipal\nCenter on May 21 to honor the memory of Aiyana and other victims of police\nviolence and demand demilitarization of police. We should draw as much\nattention as possible to the lack ofjustice for the families of those who lost\ntheir beloved ones at the hands of the police.\n\nInvite everyone you know and join us on May 21.\nWe should stand up for the better future of our kids!

Just like Ben Carson thinks that you\u2019re Choosing\n\nto be gay and the prison is the proof of that.

THINGS\nHAVE BEEN VERY SILENT ON HIS BEHALF\n\nThe 31-year-old black man died Feb. 20 at Fairfield Medical center after he\nhad a \u201cmedical episode\u201d at the jail when deputies were moving Ariel J. Clark\nfrom one cell to another. According to police reports, Arial J. Clark, 31, was\ntoo combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest.\n\nOn February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark, reporting\nthat Clark, who was driving his wife and two Children from Buffulo to Texas,\nwas threatening to kill him and his son. Clark\u2018s wife said that a man and his\nson began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he\nhadn\u2018t slept in five days. When the police arrived, Clark was arrested, taken\nto the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint Chair for his\ncombative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some\nbreathing difficulties and deputies started Chest compression. But an hour\nlater he was pronounced dead at a local hospital.\n\nAn investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail\ninmate.\n\nNow the question is whether the jail\u2018s standard operating procedures were\nfollowed.\n\nWe would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after \u201cfighting\u201d with\nthe police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at\nhospital. For now the only thing we know is that another black man died in\npolice custody.\n\n",

You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill A|-\nGaddafi. You said in an interview: \"We came, we saw, he died\". Let's not\nforget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security,\nand that caused the death of the US. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens\nand US. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and\nCIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were\nalso injured in the attacks.\n\nYou killed Saddam Hussein and Al-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the\ncountries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat\nnot only to the US. but the whole world!\n\nYou are supporting gun control, disarming the American Citizens and at the\nsame time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders,\ncreating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq,\nAfghanistan and Syria.\n\n8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years\nago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it. You Change\nyour views very fast. You speak as a democrat and act as a republican. Sorry,\nbut you can not be our representer, you can not be the president of the United\nStates.\n\nSincerely,\nUnited Muslims of America\n\n",

He took a gun and ordered his other two brothers to take a\nvideo of the whole incident. Michael Ford, at the police vicinity opened fire\nand got the cop\u2019s attention. The filming was still in process as he\ncommanded. The first cops who appeared fired back and almost immediately\nended up drawing fire. He gave the other officer a Chance to get into position\nwhen he opened fire. It\u2019s quite not understandable why his own cop shot him\nand shot the mentality i|| man too. This is a good example of sick reality too.

Alabama happens to be one of the nation\u2019s\npoorest states which have led to overcrowd in its prison. The prison system\nhouses 24,000 inmates but it was designed for 13,000.Let me enlighten you a\nlittle on how it\u2019s going to be done. Four other larger prisons will be built\nadditionally to prevent the rate of overcrowd. Even though one would have\ntaught of using this money for projects like health care facilities and other, he\nChose prisons.

    "text": "A young black guy who was mentally disabled decided to end his life, but will\nonly do that by making the cops kill him. This is absolutely insane in the\nhighest order. He took a gun and ordered his other two brothers to take a\nvideo of the whole incident. Michael Ford, at the police vicinity opened fire\nand got the cop\u2019s attention. The filming was still in process as he\ncommanded. The first cops who appeared fired back and almost immediately\nended up drawing fire. He gave the other officer a Chance to get into position\nwhen he opened fire. It\u2019s quite not understandable why his own cop shot him\nand shot the mentality i|| man too. This is a good example of sick reality too. Is\nthere any explanation why cops have started shooting each other?\n\nFollow my Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamsandKalvin\n\nSubscribe to my YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/ChannellUCszPCwUDPvDCR6VRaOCDtg\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.oom/Williams8kalvin\n",

    "text": "The liberal mass media tried to overblow a story about the KKK\u2019s\nendorsement of Trump. They Claimed Donald is supported by David Duke and\n\u201cwhite supremacists\u201d. The journalists are trying to depict Trump as a racist\nand continue their attempts even after Trump officially declared \u201cI don\u2019t know\nanything about David Duke... You\u2019re asking me a question that I\u2019m supposed\nto be talking people I know nothing about.\u201d\n\nHowever, \u201cfor some reasons\u201d the same mass media in their revelation\ncampaign forgot to mention Hillary Clinton\u2019s ties to Robert Byrd, a former\nKKK leader. Hillary described him as a man of \u201csurpassing eloquence and\nnobility\u201d. In 2010 after Byrd died she released a tribute video saying \u201cIt is\nalmost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd.\nHe was not just its longest-serving member; he was its heart, its soul, and its\nhistorian. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he\nwas always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless\nadvocacy for his West Virginia constituents, his fierce defense of the\nConstitution, and the traditions of the Senate, and his passion for a\ngovernment that improves the lives of the people it serves.\u201d\n\nSo here the mass media give us an political paradox: a Republican candidate\ncan\u2019t be endorsed by a former KKK member, but a Democrat can easily show\nher respect and honor to a former racist leader without being judged for that.\nIsn\u2019t that a little hypocritical?\n\n",

She also promised to offer illegals residency and \u201ca\npath of citizenship\u201d. During the debate on 8th March she was asked about\ndeportation.\n\nClinton said: \u201cI would not deport Children. I do not want to deport family\nmembers either. I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent\ncriminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us. That\u2019s\na relatively small universe.\u201d Oh wonderful, so she admits she wants to be the\nsecond Obama, like the first one isn\u2019t enough. And we know what\u2019s behind\nthis world \u201cChildren\u201d \u2014 young men who Claim to be less than 18. Same way\nthe \u201cillegals without a criminal record\u201d is also those who are not proved to be\ncriminals yet.\n\nCrossing the US. border without permission is already a crime. A crime that\nshould bring just one simple punishment \u2014 deportation and a prohibition of\nfurther entrance. We do not need a president who doesn't understand that.\nWe do not need a president who forgives this kind of crime. We do not need\nHillary.\n\n",

Matthew works at an orphanage built and run by an American Citizen\nnamed Upendo Children Centre. The main aim of this orphanage was to\nassist abandoned Children in Nairobi, Kenya. Upon Matthew\u2019s arrival in\nKenya, he insisted on not staying in the apartment allocated to him by\nauthorities but preferred to stay in the very dormitory where these Children\nstayed. He also based his choice on being in a better position to assist the\nChildren should the need arise. Mathew raped three teenagers \u2014 ages of 5, 9,\nand 15 respectively for not less than 8 times. He also maltreated a 12 year old\nboy. This outrageous act led to his sentence of 40 years imprisonment and a\nfined of $15, 863.\n\n",

Freeing himself from emotional trauma,\nCarter decided to hip his soul with music, when he put his headphones on\nand started to dance. Suddenly, officers approached him and began asking\nhim out of the premises. Apparently he had not committed any crime or\nviolated any order, so he was disturbed and begun to argue with them.\nSeriously this guy was detained for useless reasons. This is what American\npolice find interest in \u2014 unnecessary and useless way of harassing blacks.\nVery ridiculous.\n\nSubscribe to my Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/ChannellUCszPCwUDPvDCR6VRaOCDtg\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Williams8kalvin\n\n",

This is how it looks like when A White Police\nkills a black Civiliian, and also feels it\u2019s his right to sue the dead because\nsympathizers gave him a sleepless night. If it was lawful to kill Quintonio\nLeGrier because he was in abnormal state of mind according to the cops,\nthen we ask, how about the shooting of Bettie Jones? The story is always\nrewritten and painted when it comes to dealing with race. Racial disparity and\nsegregation cannot be overlooked in America. There is too much level of\ninhumanity. The cops still things it wasn\u2019t enough killing a mentally\ndisordered and an innocent woman. He still has the balls to sue even the\ndead. This is what living in America is like, if you are black.\n\n",

REMEMBER: Police is not a guarantee of peaceful streets...\nnot in the police states of America.\n\nMoral of the story: educate yourself, stand up for your constitutional rights and\ntake the power back from these public \"servants.\"#PowerToThePeopIe.

They believe they are\njudge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law,\nit is theirjob to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot\nsomeone who is not a threat simply because that person \"deserves it\" in their\neyes.\n\nIt will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the\ndifference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will\nget away with it.\n\nIn comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand\nthat theirjob is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,\nthey understand that they are not the jury and this is not theirjob.\n\nBad that America trained not like this!???\n",

It\u2019s a great demonstration out troops no longer trust the President,\nand Clinton would definitely not Change the situation.\n\nNo need to remind you what mistakes can Hillary do if allowed running our\nmilitary forces \u2014 we don\u2019t need another Iraq and we definitely don\u2019t need\nanother Benghazi.\n\n",

Do they exist?\nWhere are these legendary \u201cgood cops\u201d? Sad, but according to our research\ngood cops are threatened with extinction.\n\nAfter sleepless nights with coffee and YouTube search we finally found a\ngreat example of a GOOD COP. Please welcome - Mr. Right Officer, who\ncomes to the suspect\u2019s aid, not once, not twice, but at least three times\nphysically stopping the arresting officer from abusing the suspect.\n\nIf you think that all cops SHOULD take a stand like this, then help us\nSPREAD THE WORD!\n\n",

    "text": "Please take a moment to read my story!\n\nBack in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of\nhis parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the\nground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the\nlocation of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on\n\nthe passenger's side.\n\nWhen Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the\nsituation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man\nbriefly lying unconscious on the ground.\n\nThe beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows\nthat he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?\nDamn, after all that, the only thing I may conclude is DO NOT TALK TO\nPOLICE! The following video is a prime example of why...\n\n",

    "text": "SHOCKING!!! Cops can't stop using their blue privilege for illegal parking.\nCould you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she\nrealized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face\nis priceless.\n\nThe story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for\nillegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who\nhad towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The\ndriver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under\nthreat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11\nyears and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that\nhow PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix\nthe situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer\nis to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not\nhave mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon.\n\nTo my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun.\nSuch cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give\nour Citizens a Chance to get back home alive.\n\nFor more stories, join our new brand site http://donotshoot.us/\n",

We have to keep ready to stand against all kinds of attacks\non American values and Constitutional |aws.\n\nUnfortunately our current Government approves and even provokes these\nattacks, and the liberals\u2019 offensive and violent moods make it Clear \u2014 every\nAmerican patriot has to be careful and attentive.\n\n",

For instance, police trooper\nHa|| received a \u201cneed improvement rating,\u201d his squad car was taken away,\nand his gym car was deactivated for a minor mistake. Along with Hall, police\ntrooper Johnson was denied at least five promotions after the lawsuit ended\non the basis of race.\n\nOnce again the race car is alive and well. Unfortunately, black police officers\nstill remain second-class officers and experience unfair treatment in police\ndepartment despite the fact that we live in a \u201cpost-racial\u201d society.\n\n",

Also I'd love to know the point of cops rights defenders: what would\nyou say about another \"good cop,\" who's turning his head as if he didn't see\nhis partner attempt to hurt the man in wheelchair? Good cops keep silence,\nhuh?\n\nSuch incidents can't happen again, we need to get cops that can't handle their\ntempers off of the streets. Guys, what do you think about it?

But despite these efforts,\nstudents who are LGBT continue to face a harsh reality....\n\nMay 24,25 Westboro baptist Church is planning to stand against tolerance in\neducation system near LGBT-friendly Lawrence High School. They want to\n\"remind this nation that the parents, students, teachers and staff of the high\nschools celebrate disobedience to God's law.\" They are just inciting hate riots\nand violence! Their right to protest infringes on others rights! Personally I\nhave had enough of those assholes.

According to one of the witnesses, he was so mad about\nthe high profile killing of unarmed black men, so he burned the building.\n\nAbdulwalia\u2018s anger at police was not a good reason to burn down some\napartments, but injustice brought him to this action. Either way, crime should\nnot be tolerated. But we have to start thinking about the message he was\ntrying to send: having a black president Changes almost nothing.\n\n",

According\nto a report from the Center for Immigration Studies, the average annual SSA\nretirement benefit for legal Citizens is roughly $14,772.\n\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, the proposal also demands another $2.1 billion for\nrefugees.\n\nThis just says it all. Again and again he ignores the needs of American\nCitizens, but has no problem taking their hard earned moneyjust give it to\npeople who deserve it the least. I guess Veterans don\u2018t need a better social\n\nsecurity.\n\nThank you Obama for betraying America.\n",

As usual, no Charges were ever filed against the\nofficers involved in Bethea's death.\n\nThere is no doubt that Bethea was murdered. Have you noticed that it took 20\nminutes passed by before another officer summoned a nurse and they\nattempted to revive Bethea. All of bastard cops who were there should be in\nprison for murder. America, it's not a black or white problem... but a blue one.\n\n",

Retired marine Frank\nLarison recently received a letter by the HOA, ordering him to remove his\n\u201cmarine stickers\u201d from his Chevy car. Frank and his lawyer Claim that he will\nface $50 a day if he refuses to do so. If he does not play those fines, he will\nbe towed.\n\nHave you ever heard of someone receiving a notification to remove Obama\nstickers? LGBT stickers? Those terrorists Black Lives Matter stickers? Well,\n\nme neither! The liberal rage comes only to those who love the Old Glory or\nUS. Armed Forces.\n\nOur whole society is ill. Libtards are allowed to do whatever they want while\neven the smallest demonstration of love and devotion to America causes an\nimmediate intervention from the authorities.\n\n",

The school Climate has a direct impact on both how well students\nlearn and how well they interact with other people. More and more teachers\ntoday understand the importance of socialization and try to make their Classes\nmore friendly where each student feels involved. But despite these efforts,\nstudents who are LGBT continue to face a harsh reality....\n\nMay 24,25 Westboro baptist Church is planning to stand against tolerance in\neducation system near LGBT-friendly Lawrence High School. They want to\n\"remind this nation that the parents, students, teachers and staff of the high\nschools celebrate disobedience to God's law.\" They are just inciting hate riots\nand violence! Their right to protest infringes on others rights! Personally I\nhave had enough of those idiots. Someone should picket them (in return)!!\nAny volunteers willing to help me drown out their voices of hatred?\n\nPlease, DM us for more information and we can stop their nonsense - to put\nthem on the right way!\n\n",

When Brown reached for her license,\nLopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover, Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor\nBrown, who was beat and pepper\u2014sprayed by police. Brown is not the only\nvictim, her kids had suffered from pepper spray too.\n\nThe US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why\nthe hell they treat us as animals? This will not stop until cops are held\npersonally and financially responsible for their actions.\n\nCould you imagine, if soldiers acted like this towards Civilians in a combat\nzone? 100% it would be treated as a war crime. So why do we have another\nattitude to people in blue?\n\n",

The cop\nsaid that his misconduct was \u201cjustified\u201d because the man had spit at him.\n\nAlmost one year after the incident, the footage showing the punch was\nreleased. Personally, I didn\u2019t notice in the video the suspect spitting at\nDickson. However, the police department didn\u2019t consider it necessary to\n\npunish the cop. The only penalty he got was a suspension without pay for 1\nday.\n\nIs it really enough for excessive force use?\n",

Thus, the ban on dreadlocks\ncaused a lot of unnecessary stress.\n\nThe ban on loos, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until\nJanuary 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option.\nNow the rules allow dreadlocks and looks but only if they are less than a half-\ninch wide.\n\nWell, it took months for the Army to recognize that black women have\ndifferent hair texture.\n\n",

She began to take him to local museums such as the\nApex, the Sights and Sounds Black Cultural Museum and the Fernbank\nMuseum of Natural History.\n\nTo improve Leon\u2019s skills of painting he began to attend art Classes of R.\nGregory Christies. Non-profit organization the Southwest Atlanta Youth\nBusiness Organization (SWAYBO) also helped Leon in many ways.\nAccording to blacknews.com, the organization gave him lessons of \u201cpoise\nand presentation, public speaking, sales and marketing at marketplaces and\nhow to perform basic accounting formulas.

The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next\nyear the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company.\nOne of co-founders said \u201cWe don\u2019t define profit in terms of money. The profit\nis the patronage of the community, which allows the store to seIf-support.\u201d\nDrum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history,\nsomething beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of\nthe shop: the drum is for \u201ccommunications within the diaspora,\u201d and the\nspear symbolizes \u201cwhatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the\npeople.\u201d\n\nThe best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the\nAutobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver\u2019s Soul on Ice.\n\nThis bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores.\nDrum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a \"free\nspaces\" for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital\nissues. Let's not forget our legacy! We need this drum and we need this spear\n\ntoday, in 2017.\n\n#blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness\n#africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america\n#usa #blackscience #education #diversity #drumandspear #blackpower\n\n",

Unfortunately, many of these hypocrites have infiltrated the\nAmerican establishment. Such people benefit from regional conflicts and war\nis nothing more than business for them. It was these people who launched the\nmissiles that never hit no terrorists but led to Civilian casualties. It is them who\nkeep receiving money from the same actors who sponsor ISIS and other\ngroups. These people want more American involvement because it means\nmore money for them and they don\u2019t care about the terrorists. In fact, radicals\nreally help them increase their bloody income. The only way to resist the\ncorrupt elites is to oppose military actions with no particular aim and promote\nanti-terrorist agenda! Focus on what\u2019s truly important and we will end the war\nin Syria sooner than you can imagine.\n\n",

We\u2019ve been watching our military\ncommandership wasting lives of American soldiers for too long, let\u2019s hope it\nwill end now when Trump is in Charge.\n\nA new Marine Corps artillery unit was sent to assist Syrian opposition in\nRaqqa, according to Army Maj. Josh T. Jacques, a spokesman for US.\nCentral Command. The artillery unit recently replaced about 400 Marines from\nthe 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which provided artillery support to Kurdish\nand Syrian Arab forces expected to launch an offensive against Raqqa.\n\nWe must deal with ISIS and end the terrorist threat once and for all.\nUnfortunately that\u2019s hardly possible because of the corruption in the\nGovernment. The Swamp in DC is still not drained from people like Senator\nMcCain, and that\u2019s why our troops not only focus on defeating terrorism, but\nalso getting involved into another regime Change venture and possibly\nanother oil war.\n\nWe\u2019re fighting radical Islamists, but we\u2019re also siding with Syrian opposition,\nthe very same radical Islamists, and there\u2019s absolutely no guarantee that\nthese rebels won\u2019t replace ISIS when it\u2019s gone.\n\nThere\u2019s only one Chance to avoid another Iraq: Trump and the American\nnation must defeat globalist politicians and the Establishment. All we can do\nnow is to pray for all American soldiers to return back home alive and safe.\n\n",

    "text": "The administration is requesting a $54 billion increase in military spending for\n2018. Not a small sum, it\u2019s roughly equal to the entire annual military budget\nof France, larger than the defense budgets of the United Kingdom, Germany,\nand Japan, and only $12 billion less than the entire Russian military budget of\n2015. But what about domestic and State Department spending? For\nexample, such an increase for the Department of Defense means 31% cut in\nthe EPA\u2019s budget and a 29% cut in the State Department. In other words, it\u2019s\na great number of opportunities squandered in favor of the interests of high-\npowerful warmongers in our government. Environment, diplomacy, alternative\nenergy, housing or infrastructure repair? Not today. Today they want\nthousands of peaceful people to die for their money interests. And they use\n\nevery opportunity to start another war, they are acting the same way in Syria.\nStart thinking!\n\n",

    "text": "Everyday we watch, read and receive news of police beating, assaulting, and\nkilling innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common\nthat people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were\nwondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,\nkarma's coming back for blue pigs!\n\nA shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police\nofficers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two\nofficers for seemingly no reason.\n\nThe incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two\nschool police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza\nshop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of\npolice do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do |itera||y\nnothing without using their guns.\n\nCops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their\nown laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with Chemical and\nelectrical ways, rape or even kill you \"doing theirjob.\" All those things and\nmore are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my\nrights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.\n\nLook around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine\nabout it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is\nwhy cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our\nancestors did it for centuries.\n\nTake out a few dozen cops and the rest will Change. Amen.\n",

They will cut the support of Black families in the US to kill\ninnocent kids in Syria. How did we come to this?!\n\n",

    "text": "New administration\u2019s budget proposal to Congress includes $1.7 trillion in\nmandatory spending cuts over 10 years, including $800 billion from Medicaid\nand $193 billion from food stamps. At the same time, this proposal, called \"A\nNew Foundation for American Greatness\", includes a boost in military\nspending and $1.6 billion for the construction of the border wall with Mexico.\nTo be honest, I\u2019m not sure, that the wall and another pointless war, instead of\naffordable health care and help for those in need, is what we have to keep our\nfocus on. It seems like republicans are using every single possibility to get\nmore money for their wars, and they don\u2019t mind it if average Americans live in\npoverty or without affordable medicine. Why additional billions to Military? Our\nDepartment of Defense budget is already bigger than military budgets of the\nnext eight countries combined, isn\u2019t it enough? Here is what Senate Minority\nLeader Chuck Schumer said: \"Based on what we know about this budget, the\ngood news -- the only good news -- is that it\u2019s likely to be roundly rejected by\nmembers of both parties here in the Senate -- just as the last budget was\"\n\n",

In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in\na public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense\naltercation with a student.\n\nAccording to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim,\nBrian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom.\n\nThe student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a\nbrief Clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him.\n\nI don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more\nthen a bunch of bu||ies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever\nhappened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an\nofficer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide\nsomething and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not\ndestruction of evidence a crime?\n\nWhat do you think about it guys? Please, share or comment below.\n",

Our military\npresence in Syria now doesn\u2019t serve American interests. Our soldiers are\nthere to fight and die for Globalists, Saudis and Israelis, but not for\nAmericans. And that\u2019s why we keep on talking about it: this policy is directly\nopposite to the \u201cAmerica First\u201d concept.\n\nI believe Trump can fix it, just like he promised. Sadly days after days and\nweeks after weeks of Trump\u2019s presidency there are no Changes in that\ndirection. Israel captured a Syrian region named Golan Heights in 1967, and\ntoday this land is internationally considered to be occupied territory. Israelis\nwant to use Trump\u2019s influence so the world would acknowledge Israeli\nsovereignty. Trump is a dealer, and maybe he\u2019s trying make a deal out of it,\nbut there\u2019s one important thing here: under no Circumstances can our\nsoldiers\u2019 lives be put at risk for that. So many times during the presidential\ncampaign Trump said \u201clet\u2019s bring back our soldiers home\u201d, and now it\u2019s\nreally time to do it. This is not our war.\n\n",

Just to make it\nClear: our government is proposing spending cuts to most government\nagencies to pay for large increases in military, and everything we got from this\nis more and more Civilians deaths. EPA, State and other development\nprograms, Agriculture, Labor, Justice, Health and Human Services,\nEducation, and many other domestic agencies faced more than 20% cuts in\ntheir budgets, and only the Department of Defense has grown by 10%.\nHowever, terrorists weren\u2019t destroyed in \u201930 days\u2019 and it seems like they\nwon\u2019t be destroyed in the Closest perspective. I mentioned before, and I will\ndo it again: this is not a war against terrorism or a war \u2018for freedom\u2019, it\u2019s\nanother example of money conflict, filling politician's pockets with blood\nmoney is the main goal of it.

I\nreally want to trust these words, but unfortunately many high-ranked\npoliticians want to force Trump to pull America into another war.\n\nHere\u2019s what Ron Paul thinks about it: \u201cBy the end of this month, Defense\nSecretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will\ndeliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan,\nIraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send\nhis national security team back to the drawing board \u2014 or replace them. There\nis no way another \u201csurge\u201d in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria)\nputs America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will\nsucceed any better than it did the last time.\u201d\n\nSyria will be just another oil war; Iraq cost our country 4,500 soldier lives, and\nwhy the hell are we still in Afghanistan? We\u2019ve started the whole Afghanistan\nthing to beat the Soviets, and no there\u2019s no Soviet Union on the world map,\nand all the communists left on this planet are only Chinese and Californian\nstudents.\n\n",

It's\ntime for politicians to take care of the US. residents instead of fating them, as\nwell as other nationals, to death.\n\nWe're organizing a peaceful gathering to draw public attention to the above-\nmentioned terrible problem. Our President and Congress must listen to those\nwho granted them power - us, the people. If you also think that there should\nonly be peace, come with us and let's make it happen.\n\nStop war!

When King refused,\nwhich by the way was a perfectly legal thing to do, the police officer broke out\nthe car window and arrested her in a brutal way. Instead of simply Citing her,\nthe police officer demanded the woman to obey and threw her to the ground.\nWhen you're Black no violation is small enough.

TWO GEORGIA POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN FIRED AFTER\nVIDEO SHOWS THEM KICK BLACK MAN DURING TRAFFIC STOP\n\nTwo Georgia police officers have been fired after police released the footage\nof the encounter where two Gwinnett County cops kicking a black college\nstudent during a traffic stop.\n\nAccording to a police report, 21-year-old Demetrius Ho||ins was pulled over\nnear Lawrenceville for Changing |ines several times without signaling. When\ncops stopped him, Ho||ins was seen on video standing with his hands raised\nbefore one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face, and the\nsecond cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Ho||ins in his face.\n\nThe 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach\nhim. Ho||ins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn\u2018t have\nanything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the\nincident cops wrote in their police report that Ho||ins resisted arrest and\nClaimed that Ho||ins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted\narrest. Cops |itera||y lied and had no shame.\n\nThis incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law\nenforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions. Resignation\nis not the answer. We did not hear any criminal Charges, even though they\nadmit the cops broke the law. Where is the justice? FINALLY! TWO\nGEORGIA POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN FIRED AFTER VID...\n\n",

As we all know, CPS has been\nstruggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to\nwhere we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the\ncommunity as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to\nimprove our Chicago...\n\nAll of the things that you do for our City never go unnoticed. All of the free\nconcerts you host and all the time you spend here in the City really show you\ncare. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility\naway from artists, but it hasn\u2019t Changed you...\n\nWe thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others\nhave put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored\nand as though we don\u2019t have enough support from bigger influences like you.\nBeing born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many\nstereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers clue to the frequent\nviolence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that\nsomeone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You\nand your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be\nsuccessful, still be self-made...\n\nOnce again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the City we\nknow and love, Chicago.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt\n\nLake View High School Students\n\nChicago, Illinois\"\n\nIt's not the full letter, but some extracts. lt's sweet to observe how young\npeople don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who\ncares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back.\nIt should work.\n\nAs an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn\u2019t forget\nwho made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people\u2019s love.\nThat\u2019s cool that this love goes back and forth!\n\nWe need more of these positive black people on the media, because some\npeople forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day\ndifferent race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes.\n\n#blackexcellence #blackperfeotion #blackbeauty #blackbusiness\n#africanamerioan #blackoommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america\n#usa #blackscience #education #diversity #Chancetherapper #Chicago #music\n#hiphop #rap\n\n",

According to Lim, he saw the\nunidentified woman stealing eyelashes. But, in the video, you can hear the\nwoman tell Lim, \u201cCheck my bag. I\u2019m telling you I don\u2019t have anything.\u201d And\nwhy did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what?\n\nCorine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Chapter of the NAACP demanded\nthat Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, lwant it be\nnot only the boycott of this exact store but all shops and stores where Black\npeople were treated disrespectfully! We don\u2019t believe apologies, especially\nwhen we know that this man is sorry only about profit he's going to lose!\n\n",

Perez served seven years, but because he is not a US. citizen,\nImmigration Customs Enforcement detained him, stripped his legal status and\n\nbegan the deportation process.\nThis system doesn't appreciate our sacrifices.

I\u2019m telling you I don\u2019t have anything.\u201d And\nwhy did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what?\n\nCorine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Chapter of the NAACP demanded\nthat Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, lwant it be\nnot only the boycott of this exact store but all shops and stores where Black\npeople were treated disrespectfully! We don\u2019t believe apologies, especially\nwhen we know that this man is sorry only about profit he's going to lose!\nWilliams&Kalvin www.youtube.com\n\n",

She says: \"Diversity on the bench is so important because\nthe people that come to court come from all different walks of life, different\nethnic backgrounds, different religious backgrounds.\"\n\nHowever, if it's a sign of diversity, this is a very weak sign. Just think, we are\nindigenous inhabitants of this land and we were cut off all privileges since\ngabachos came and stole our land. So, it took almost 500 years for our\nwoman to reach a prestigious position in the government that is not really\ncaring about us! Whether there are latinos or not, authorities will continue to\ndeport us from our indigenous land!\n\n",

As a teenager,\nHenderson manufactured and sold drugs in his native home in Los Angeles.\nBy 19, he was already earning US $35,000 per week. Henderson was later\napprehended and imprisoned for 10 years after one of his men was caught\ncarrying a big shipment. It was in prison that he discovered his natural flair for\ncooking, while he was on kitchen duty.\n\nHe was released early for good behavior and soon started working for some\nof LA\u2019s top restaurants before venturing into Las Vegas. After experiencing\nmany rejections due to his felonious past, Henderson finally managed to land\na job at Caesar\u2019s Palace. It was only a matter of time before he finally started\ngetting recognition and awards, including best Las Vegas Chef in 2001. All\nthe fame and success hasn\u2019t gotten to Henderson\u2019s head though and he has\ncontinued to share his experiences with at-risk youth to show what they can\nachieve in life with the right Choices.\n\n",

He became enamored with the legal\nprofession and went to law school right after his parole.\n\nHe finally passed the bar exams in Michigan and Washington, DC after\nwaiting many years to be approved by the respective boards. Afterwards,\nManville worked tirelessly to improve the prison system and represented\nvarious inmates and prison guards in Civil cases. Nowadays, Manville teaches\nlaw at Michigan State University, where he hopes the insights he shares with\nstudents inspire them to someday help improve the system as well.\n~ListVerse~\n\n",

But after all, Kaepernick is a great athlete who not just sat out the\nnational anthem in protest, but also gave back to the community by donating\nto the Black Youth Project 100.\n\nKaepernick donated to the Chicago Chapter of the organization toward\n\u201cChapter-specific ideas and endeavors centered on advancing Agenda to\nBuild Black Futures\u201d which is dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all\nBlack people in order to improve the lives of black people in the United States\nof America.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll continue to look at other communities in Chicago, as well, as far as what\nare ways I can help and what are ways I can try to help empower those\ncommunities,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen someone strives to uplift the negativity surrounding black people, there\nis always someone who will distort the positivity. But we don\u2018t really care\nabout haters.\n\nGoodjob, Colin.\n",

They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and Challenge\npolice brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the\ngovernment and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party\n\"the greatest threat to the internal security of the country\". They tried to Close\nit, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was\ndissolved.\n\n50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country\nstills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. lt spreads through all the country\nlike the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We\nneed a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that\ncan make Black Lives really matter.\n\nLet's get together and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the party that has\nmade the Change. Let's honor its founders and participants. Let's share their\nideas and ideals! Black Panther Party 50th Anniversary\n\n",

The goal was to \"disrupt\nthe use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations.\" Well, the\nintervention deprived aI-Qaida of a sanctuary. But aI-Qaida \u2014 even after its\nleader Osama bin Laden was killed by US. commandos \u2014 has spawned cells\nelsewhere and inspired other extremists in Syria and Iraq. And now ISIS is\nrising as the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world. So, the question\nis whether it's worth to risk the lives of thousands of American soldiers for the\nmission that hardly can be called successful? It seems that Obama should\nreview his military strategy without delay.Joih us! Veterans USA ( @veterans\nGovSpending\n\n",

These videos and instances have become so common\nthat people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were\nwondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,\nkarma's coming back for blue pigs!\n\nA shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police\nofficers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two\nofficers for seemingly no reason.\n\nThe incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two\nschool police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza\nshop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of\npolice do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do |itera||y\nnothing without using their guns.\n\nCops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their\nown laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with Chemical and\nelectrical ways, rape or even kill you \"doing theirjob.\" All those things and\nmore are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my\nrights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.\n\nLook around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine\nabout it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is\nwhy cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our\nancestors did it for centuries.\n\nTake out a few dozen cops and the rest will Change. Amen.\n",

But Obama's speech did not make sense at all. That's why we\nhave to support all police officers who refused to applaud Obama.\n\nTaking sides with these rioters and racists, Obama literally called for open war\nagainst police officers and whites.

Notice the\nlocation of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on\n\nthe passenger's side.\n\nWhen Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the\nsituation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man\nbriefly lying unconscious on the ground.\n\nThe beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows\nthat he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?\nDamn, after all that, the only thing I may conclude is DO NOT TALK TO\nPOLICE! The following video is a prime example of why...\n\n",

I appreciate the way he maintains his independent\nopinion in spite of all the pressure that is on him as the \"second Democratic\noption\". Because that is a fact. The Clinton Foundation is nothing more than\nan \"organized crime\" at it's finest, in which we are investing our taxpayers'\nmoney!\n\nHillary has no problem in accepting foreign money from the countries, like\nSaudi Arabia. Hillary has no remorse about taking money from countries that\nabuse the rights of women, while she has always had her own alleged\nfeminist stance. She does not refrain from receiving money from the countries\nthat prosecute, torture and execute LGBT on the legal basis, although Hillary\nhas always been a \"defender\" of the minorities.\n\nSo, why are so many people going to vote for her?

    "text": "Illegal immigrant invasion is going at full speed and drug cartels are their most\npowerful weapon.\n\nRecently a huge drug cartel operation was discovered in North Carolina. Over\nthe course of the investigation, authorities seized six pounds of crystal meth,\neight pounds of marijuana, 49.3 grams of heroin, four handguns and $2.5\nmillion in cash, according to a press release. \u201cIt would be safe to say that the\nmoney would be taken back to Mexico, and that\u2019s where the source of the\ncocaine was,\u201d special agent Tim Stone said.\n\nThis is good news, but sadly this operation is just one of the thousands, which\nmakes it just a slap on the wrist. Our traitor government does nothing to\nprevent drug influx, but only trying to create the presence of an effort. The\nmost part of this poison comes through southern border, but it is still as\nunprotected as it possibly can be and drug cartels are abusing it as much as\nthey can.\n\nAt the expense of our tax dollars and lives of our youth, our government\nofficials continue to make some kinds of vile deals with drug cartels to get\nfilthy rich and gain more control over weaken nation.\n\nOnly a huge wall with gun towers will stop this invasion. Trump is our only\nhope for a better future!\n\n",

Cooke is a law student, so she knows her rights. When she\nrefused to consent to search, she was told to wait for a K\u20149 unit to arrive\nbefore she could leave.\n\nCooke didn\u2019t commit any crime, that\u2019s why she wanted to leave, but officers\nhad the different plans. She was thrown to the ground by the male agent and\nthe female agent deployed the taser. After she screamed from the pain for\nseveral seconds, she was handcuffed, while agents illegally opened her truck\nand searched it. Of course, they found nothing. She spent over an hour in\nhandcuffs and then about 4 hours in the US customs Station in Ogdensburg\nbefore she could go home.\n\nThis girl\u2019s day was totally ruined because cops thought that she looked\nsuspicious. After they ILLEGALLY searched her vehicle, she couldn\u2019t go.\n\nThis is what real terrorism looks like!\n",

    "text": "All people have to understand that the police service is exactly like a secret\ngay Club, the reason being that no one knows what goes on inside there even\nif it\u2019s evident. There\u2019s a kind of code of silence, even if you saw something or\njust know something about other police officer, you keep silence about it. But\nif you are in a member of a Club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your\nsecrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other\ncops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the\nmisconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally\nwithholding the information about officer misconduct were upper\nadministrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly\nenough, \u201cSworn officer of the court\u201d is most likely to lie than the Citizen he is\neven accusing. So, the lie is a norm for the officers who are keeping the code\nof silence, and it\u2019s a miracle if a police officer tells the truth.\n\nSubscribe to our Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/ChannellUCszPCwUDPvDCR6VRaOCDtg\n\nFollow my Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamsandKalvin\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.oom/Williams8kalvin\n",

In popular\nculture, he will be remembered as the man who was not afraid when it came\nto speaking his mind -- someone who was not shy of talking about things\nunrelated to boxing, and would always take the right stand when needed.\n\nHe risked his career and reputation by opposing the US-Vietnam War.\nFurthermore, he refused to serve in the US Army and in the process, was\naccused of committing a felony.\n\nNow that he is gone, this world is left with memories, and a void that cannot\nbe filled. May Allah rest his soul in peace and paradise!!!\n\n",

The cop\nsaid that his misconduct was \u201cjustified\u201d because the man had spit at him.\n\nAlmost one year after the incident, the footage showing the punch was\nreleased. Personally, I didn\u2019t notice in the video the suspect spitting at\nDickson. However, the police department didn\u2019t consider it necessary to\n\npunish the cop. The only penalty he got was a suspension without pay for 1\nday.\n\nIs it really enough for excessive force use?\n",

    "text": "Everyday we watch, read and receive news of police beating, assaulting, and\nkilling innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common\nthat people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were\nwondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,\nkarma's coming back for blue pigs!\n\nA shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police\nofficers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two\nofficers for seemingly no reason.\n\nThe incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two\nschool police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza\nshop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of\npolice do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do |itera||y\nnothing without using their guns.\n\nCops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their\nown laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with Chemical and\nelectrical ways, rape or even kill you \"doing theirjob.\" All those things and\nmore are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my\nrights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.\n\nLook around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine\nabout it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is\nwhy cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our\nancestors did it for centuries.\n\nTake out a few dozen cops and the rest will Change. Amen.\n",

Notice the\nlocation of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on\n\nthe passenger's side.\n\nWhen Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the\nsituation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man\nbriefly lying unconscious on the ground.\n\nThe beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows\nthat he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?\nDamn, after all that, the only thing I may conclude is DO NOT TALK TO\nPOLICE! The following video is a prime example of why...\n\n",

I appreciate the way he maintains his independent\nopinion in spite of all the pressure that is on him as the \"second Democratic\noption\". Because that is a fact. The Clinton Foundation is nothing more than\nan \"organized crime\" at it's finest, in which we are investing our taxpayers'\nmoney!\n\nHillary has no problem in accepting foreign money from the countries, like\nSaudi Arabia. Hillary has no remorse about taking money from countries that\nabuse the rights of women, while she has always had her own alleged\nfeminist stance. She does not refrain from receiving money from the countries\nthat prosecute, torture and execute LGBT on the legal basis, although Hillary\nhas always been a \"defender\" of the minorities.\n\nSo, why are so many people going to vote for her? That's a secret for me.\nWhat's your opinion on that point?\n\n",

It\nis well-known how libtards are eager to blame our forefathers for being racist.\nYet they always forget to underpin their empty words with facts.

A black\nsoldier was paid $10 a month with a $3 clothing fee taken out, while a white\nsoldier was paid $13 a month but was not forced to pay a clothing allowance.\nAlmost a twofold difference!

We had a moment to\npresent economic or social advancement plans to president Obama, yet we\nrefused and let anti- blacks trick us into thinking that was not elected to\nbenefit just black people alone. President Obama was elected for a reason.\nHe was the stepping stone for blacks to rise but it was blown away. Now, it is\nthe time of White America to rebuild and advance and make their race great.\nThe war for power between blacks and whites is very real, but the black\ncommunity has forgotten. Consequently, the power of black is fading day by\nday because those in position are descending from the ladder every day.

They believe they are\njudge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law,\n\nit is theirjob to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot\nsomeone who is not a threat simply because that person \"deserves it\" in their\n\neyes.\n\nIt will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the\ndifference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will\n\nget away with it.\n\nIn comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand\nthat theirjob is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,\nthey understand that they are not the jury and this is not theirjob.\n\nBad that America trained not like this!???\n",

The shooting took place in\nClassrooms in Snyder Hall.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man\nresponsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three\nhandguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a\nfight, because he had body armor and stash of ammunition.\n\nOne of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people\u2019s\nreligions before he began firing.\n\nThe hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34,\nand quoted a doctor who said that an \"army\" of doctors and nurses had\nvolunteered to help.\n\nIt's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is\nthe only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few\nmonths. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn\u2019t it time for some\ngun control yet?\n\nSome white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported\nBLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This\ndude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a\nfew hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's\nwhite. And honestly, word \"shooting\" isn't used correctly here. Can we call it\nterror? Oh, wait. White male though...\n\n#UCC #Oregon #shooting\n",

    "text": "The leader of radical religious group Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan,\nannounced that 20th anniversary Million Man March rally will take place on\nOctober 10, 2015 in Washington, DC, at the National Mall. Organizers of the\nMillion Man March call forjustioe, standing against the police and for blacks,\nLatinos and incarcerated.\n\nThey say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among\nradical groups. Only black activists say \u201cblack lives matter\u201d, forgetting the fact\nthatjustice is when all lives matter.\n\nAmericans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the\nlaw, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes\nover the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the\nimmigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should\nbe imprisoned.\n\nGiven the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in\nFerguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan\u2019s\nbenevolent intentions.\n\nThis Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim\ncommunities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent\nnews about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal\nRobert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on\nAmerican extremists to execute him.\n\nThere is no problem, if whoever wants to live in the United States. But he\nshould live here legally; he should not break the law. lt\u2019s justice.\n\n",

To fix a system that allows for local\nprosecutors to investigate their friends at the police department when there is\nan officer-involved shooting. To fix a system that has drug laws that\ndisproportionately arrest black and brown people for using drugs when white\npeople use at the same rate. To fix a system that has built a private industry\noff the backs of prisoners laboring for pennies. To fix a system that doesn't\nvideo record the actions of law enforcement at all times. To fix a system that\ncriminalizes young women who are pimped and sexually trafficked before\nthey even turn 18. To fix a system that does not collect any national data on\nincidents when police use excessive force or discharge their firearm. To fix a\nsystem that has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world.\nTo fix a system that has created a school to prison pipeline by harsher school\ndiscipline practices for young students of color. To fix a system of policing that\ntargets communities of color by programs like \"Stop & Frisk\" or \"Broken\nWindows.\"\n\nThis is why I march. This is why we all should march in order to build a better\nfuture for our kids. We should fight the institutional racism in the country.\n\nLike and share if you want to help the movement!\n",

There's always\nwas a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be\n\nfollowed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need\nof swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would\nbe exposed to, and of their need of protection.\n\nAnd we, American Christians, should remember about it.
