I opted out of the elections and i had many Black people all up in my case,
telling me how i was wrong and how i needed to make my vote count for Mrs.
Clinton, all just to make sure Trump doesn't become president.

Well now all i want to say is get over Trump and Clinton, they are rich white
people, the elite who were born into and are a part of the system.

I dream of liberation, not staying a slave under Hillary or Trump, so forget

"Find out how to escape bad credit reports: goo.gllGAerz

A recent study has revealed some surprising differences in credit scores
between African-Americans and Caucasians.

The study showed that Caucasians earning less than $25,000 per year were
likely to have better credit scores than African-Americans earning between

$65,000 and $75,000 per year.

Overall, the study found 27 percent of all credit reports belonging to
Caucasians were poor, compared to 48 percent of those belonging to African-

Americans.

Although credit reporting is supposed to be free of prejudice, some
researchers said the system may be inherently stacked against minorities.

"CHARLESTON COP WHO FATALLY SHOT BLACK MAN ASKS JUDGE TO
DROP CHARGES, CITING DOUBLE RISK

North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed 50-year-
old Scott after an April 2015 traffic stop, and his attorneys urged the court to
drop murder Charge due to the double jeopardy that Slager faced before the
shooting. According to ex-cop‘s attorneys, their defendant acted in self-
defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times,
hitting Scott five times from behind.

Slager‘s defense attorney‘s:

“The doubIe-teaming of Slager is a chilling example of how far politically
motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather
their own nests at the expense of a public servant who had to make a split-
second life or death decision that will be seoond-guessed by comfortable
armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.”

The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken
brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager‘s
dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him
about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott
jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a
bystander‘s video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire.

We‘ve seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead
black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none
of them found guilty. That‘s why today it‘s important to send a message to
other police officers that if they do this, it‘s harsh penalty to pay."

which point, he drove off.

He added that the man “wasn’t resisting at all until they tased him”

After tasing the man police officers used their elbows and fists, as the man lay
on the ground, screaming for help.

The man was heard screaming in pain: “My fucking back is killing me! Oh

"Joshua was born in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in Indianapolis. Two months
before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two
sons.

Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of
his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in
Indianapolis at the age of 26.

Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what
authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off-
duty firefighter.

The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest
Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said.

Suddenly, Boxley said, a car out her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old
sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her
off — who she believed was a Chicago police officer — stopped and got out of
their cars.

At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a
gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley.

She said the man got inside his car but exited again and “he just started
shooting,” hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his
gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal
legally owned the gun and did not fire it.

Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began
shooting him.

“I was hoping my brother wasn’t dead,” said Boxley.

Beal’s mother said he was a father to two Children, a 4-year-old and a 2—year-
old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother.

“This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They
have no consideration for life,” - Tiffaney Boxley.

Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will
say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own
death, armed or unarmed.

Michelle Lee Shirley was fatally shot by Torrance police officer as she
approached a group of police officers in her car.

Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were
warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley,
who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars.
When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at
her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting.

After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor—UCLA Medical Center
and was pronounced dead.

Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to
balance motherhood and law school. In a video titled, “It‘s Up to Us,” she
was asking people to take seriously a mental disorder and seek help because
ignoring it can take away years of people‘s lives.

What the police ruled ""natural causes"" turned out to be that he starved to

Ajudge then ruled him incompetent to stand trial. He should have been
transported to a local mental health facility, but he wasn't. Apparently there
wasn't one that had room for him. Three months later he was found dead in
his cell. No meds had ever been administered. He had never made it to a

keep enforcing her “no marriage licenses” policy — an attempt to avoid
issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples — while she appeals the trial
court’s preliminary ruling.

Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis will have to Choose whether to issue marriage
licenses, defying her Christian conviction, or continue to refuse them, defying
a federal judge who could pummel her with fines or order that she be hauled

off to jail.

For Ms. Davis to enact her own personal policy is completely unacceptable.
She is on her fourth marriage, a sinner according to her Bible, yet she’s
screaming about religious convictions. What a hypocrite!

And she doesn't even perform the ceremony, only issue a license. What her

"The US. Constitutional Convention signed and adopted the Constitution at

Constitution has been amended twenty-seven times. All of amendments are
steps that made the United States the greatest country in the world.

The US. Constitution is not only the law, it is the basis of the country. Every
true patriot respects it.

Unfortunately, last decade has become the time of nihilism. More and more
people don’t respect American law. More and more people come to the
United States and some of them don’t feel reverence for our Constitution. It
goes without saying that illegals who already broke the immigration law and
will violate the supreme law easily. But the worst thing is that the current
president of the United States and some high-ranking officials also spit upon
the Constitution. They call for ban the right to bear arms, a confederate flag (I
think this flag reflects not slavery, but important part of American history) and
some liberals ban even the Old Glory -- a school district in Tennessee has
banned all flags and banners, including the US. flag -- and so on. The same
regards the lran deal.

have to do it in God’s name! America has to be great again because we are

"Barack Obama and his team have spent two months working to secure 41
percent for Iran deal. And now they Claim enourmous victory.

Under the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the

Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect — a legally binding long-
term agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of
dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed.

Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been
obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can
never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in
2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and
the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama.

But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to Change a
subject to a vote — not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be
treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and
the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his
presidential veto.

The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to
overturn such a veto — and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So,
instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67
senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or
more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to
support the deal.

Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will
simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking
and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42
percent.

Barack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn’t care
about Americans. All what he cares is his outsized ambitions."

"Gay the force be with you: Star Wars soldier comes out

Hero soldier Sinjir Rath Velus comes out in a new novel, which is part of the
smash hit sci-fi franchise with arCh-baddie Darth Vader.

The space warrior appears in Star Wars: Aftermath, which bridges the gap
between Return of the Jedi and new film The Force Awakens.

Sinjir, an Imperial turncoat who now serves in Luke Skywalker’s Rebellion, is
the first major gay role to be part of the Star Wars universe. He reveals his
sexuality to female bounty hunter Jas Emari, who tries to Chat him up.
Chuck Wendig, author of Star Wars: Aftermath, said: ""I don’t think his
sexuality needs to be this giant plot point. At the same time, it’s part of who
he is.

Isn't that great, guys? Ain't no lie, It's a big step forward. We want to thank the
creators of the new ""Star Wars"" for the incredible courage and opposition to
conservative bias in Hollywood Cinema. There should be a special
organization in Hollywood that will protect the rights of gay actors. There
should be at least one gay Character in every movie in order to help the

"Why am | against individuals who live in the United States illegally? On the

United States very much.

If the government gives an amnesty to them who broke the immigration law, it
doesn’t respect Americans who love their country. Why Citizens cannot break
the law, but illegals can? What nonsense!

Illegal immigrants work illegally and they don’t pay taxes. Many of them
commit a crime. And the police have no their finger prints because illegals
have never obtained US. visa.

If people want to live in the United States, they should require U.S. residence
permit. Illegals should not be amnestied. How can we be the greatest nation

"Vatican Says Transgender Man Cannot Become A Godparent

The Vatican has rejected a request by a transgender man in Spain to become
a godparent, ruling that his sexual identity means he is incapable of carrying
out the task.

Alex Salinas was asked by his family to be godfather to his nephew, but the
bishop of his local diocese on Spain’s southern coast questioned his gender
identity.

Salinas was born a woman but has since undergone hormone therapy and
has a male ID in Spain. He is now waiting for gender surgery.

Bishop Rafael Zornoza Boy of Cadiz and Ceuta rejected the family’s request
to name Salinas as a godfather. Then, after a media storm, the bishop wrote
to the Vatican for advice.

Zornoza published the Vatican’s reasoning for rejecting Salinas’ wish.

It said transsexual behavior “reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to
the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the
truth of one’s own sexuality.”

The pope supported gays, but now for some reason the transman wasn't
allowed to be a godfather in Spain, an entirely Catholic, but at the same time,
the most friendly country towards the LGBT community. Anyway it's just
another superstition of Church. Funny."

"Innocent Bystanders Could Face Criminal Charges for Not Jumping in to Help
Officer Make Arrest

Residents of Huntsville, Alabama who declined to intervene to help a police
officer subdue a suspect could face criminal prosecution under a state statute
requiring them to assist an officer in trouble. Had the situation been reversed,
however, police officers would face neither criminal nor Civil prosecution for
declining to aid a Citizen under assault by a suspect.

A man named Devonte Conerly who was suspected in a hit and run incident,
allegedly tried to disarm the police officer who stopped him. Several officers
responded to a call for assistance and eventually subdued and handcuffed
Conerly. They then rebuked several bystanders who had declined to
intervene.

Bystanders are not liable to prosecution if the failure to render aid “was
reasonable under the Circumstances,” but the burden of demonstrating that
this is the case is placed upon the accused.

When you'll see a bunch of cops beating an unarmed man, don't forget that
you can be in his place just for not helping cops in committing a crime."

"Because They Lack Crucial Training, These Cops Severely Beat a Blind
Autistic Teen Unconscious

During the incident, Abrams, 17, suffered two seizures after police used force
against him at the Green Line’s Lexington Parkway Station.

The teen suffers from Asperger’s syndrome, which causes him to strongly
dislike being touched or having people in his person space, and is considered
legally blind, wearing extremely magnified glasses.

Officers thought the non-compliance of Abrams was reason enough to justify
forcibly taking him down, which resulted in him being battered and left
unconscious.

Abrams non-compliance wasn’t done out of malice, but out of not really
understanding the situation, and believing he hadn’t done anything wrong.
Abrams’ autism makes it extremely difficult for him to interpret the intentions
or feelings of others, according to his mother. Police released the teen to the
custody of his mother rather than take him to the juvenile detention facility.

Police are trained to think like the military in combat, which means they
prioritize their own safety and the safety of fellow officers over everything
else, including that of the citizens they allegedly “protect and serve.”"

doesn’t want to rob you. Of course, not all Americans have a gun, but
criminals don’t know who is unarmed. Liberals can say that guns increase
crime rate. In fact, it is nonsense. Look at statistics: the most gun-friendly

Yet in the months surrounding the recent US. Supreme Court decision to

become increasingly willing to cast blame — seemingly hypocritically — on a
group they have often dismissed or outright ignored: Progressive Christians,

We don’t want to stir up Islamophobia, but if such manifestations of Islam
have place, it is very sorrowful for the United States. The situation in the
Middle East and the extensive propaganda of ISIS make ordinary Muslims to
become radical Islamists and take the path of war and death. If people on

"Man Dies After Police Use Pepper Spray During Arrest In Alabama

A man in Alabama collapsed and died after officers sprayed him with pepper
spray while arresting him after a chase, Tuscaloosa police said Saturday.

Police said Ware ran into nearby woods and struggled with officers when they
caught up with him. Officers sprayed him with oleoresin capsicum, more
commonly known as pepper spray, according to police. The Chemical agent
debilitates a person by causing temporary blindness and irritating a person's
nose and throat.

The six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during
an investigation, according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and
body camera footage of the incident would be released after that
investigation.

This tragedy happen accidentally, and probably the police officers didn't wish
death upon him, because they tried to give him first aid. However, the man is
dead and there is no Chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever,
but the cops will remain on duty and get away with this murder. Is this

It looks like 65-year-old reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner has found love again.
After getting divorced from Kris Jenner earlier this year, Caitlyn has not been
linked with any love interest.

According to reports, she is now dating Candis Cayne, 44, an actress and a

Caitlyn and Candis had amazing Chemistry. After her monumental life Change,
Caitlyn’s ready to open up her heart again and really, how could you ask for

"The US. flag hasn’t been lowered in honor of the murdered Marines

Monday morning, July 20, the US flag continued to fly at the top of the White
House and the US capitol building despite the fact that a gunman killed five
US Marines in Chattanooga, Tenn. President Obama hasn’t ordered to lower
a flag, though a federal law states that the flag shall be flown at haIf-staff upon
the deaths of principal figures or the governor can lower the US flag in his or
her state following the deaths of officials or members of the US Army. By
contrast, Obama ordered the flags to haIf-staff following on the same day that
as the shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The flag was lowered
to haIf-staff the day following the terrorist attack during the Boston marathon,

the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard and the following the death of
Nelson Mandela. But it hasn’t yet been lowered in honor of the service

members murdered in Tennessee.

By doing so Obama shows the highest degree of disrespect for the fallen
soldiers. It turns out that for him the soldiers as well as veterans do not

deserve any attention or respect. Soldiers are needed only when it is
necessary to send them to the next unknown operation. They considered as
meat. But in reality, they are our heroes! They were victims of a terrorist
attack. They were victims of a man who at first won refugee status and then
decided to kill in the name of Allah.

In general during the Obama presidency the country was divided in many
ways: racism became more evident, the number of illegal immigrants, who do

not even bother to learn English, because it’s enough to speak Spanish, has
increased."
"That's really cool! I think all people must realise that sexuality is not,
fundamentally, about who you want to have sex with — but who you are, and
who you love...

One of the execs on Children’s cartoon series Steven Universe has confirmed
a lesbian romance between two Characters.

The popular show is based on a young boy named Steven, who grows up
with three magical aliens — the ‘Crystal Gems’ Garnet, Amethyst and Pearl.
The show, which has already won praise for including a number of strong,
female Characters in a comparatively male-dominated genre, has now hinted
at further diversity.

That's 3000 nice! More and more shows go that route, even if it's probably just
for advertising it's still good."

"Cleveland judge won't be forced to issue warrants in Rice shooting

A divided Ohio appeals court panel on Friday said it would not force a
municipal judge to issue arrest warrants for Cleveland police officers involved
in the fatal shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in a City park last November.

Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Ronald Adrine in June found probable
cause for Officer Timothy Loehmann, who shot Rice, and his partner, Frank
Garmback, to face Charges in the shooting.

Loehmann shot Rice twice within seconds of arriving outside a City recreation
center on Nov. 22 in response to an emergency call of a man with a gun.
Rice, who was playing with an Airsoft-type replica handgun that shoots
pellets, died the next day.

By any means the justice system is trying to justify the cops, who should've
been never employed even. They shot the poor kid in 2 seconds after they
arrived, not even having time to understand the situation. Everyday police use
excessive force and weapons against unarmed people. Killers in uniform...

Let's honor Tamir's memory one more time."

Last week, in a place that bills itself as the “Friendliest Town on the Eastern
Shore,” angry residents marched to City Hall, demanding to give back a job
for Kelvin Sewell, the community’s first black police Chief.

departmental racism. After that the crowd of Sewell's supporters moved to

"Ta-Nehisi Coates on growing up in West Baltimore

The famous African-Amerioan writer Ta-Nehisi Coates grew up in West
Baltimore with people who lost a Child whether to the streets, to guns or to jail.
Today, his goal is to protect his son from the different forms of violence that
he experienced in school and on the streets.

People of color have been dealing with injustice ever since they crossed the
North American continent. For instance, in West Baltimore, Ta-Nehisi was
trained not to go to the neighborhoods unless you know this place. He was
told that you cannot tolerate anybody attempting any physically violent threat
to you. Moreover, his mom was feared that her Children would get arrested.

What does it mean? Undoubtedly, black Americans were afraid of police,
improper procedure, injustice or what is worse, being killed by police officer.
That‘s why the nationwide furor over the growing number of unarmed black
men fatally shot by police officers has put the public on a new trend in
America. In fact, this new trend caused disproportionate number of unarmed
people of color killed by police.

A teen committed suicide in a jail cell an hour after being arrested, another
suspicious case of a Black woman dying in police custody in the past week.
The second case over a week, huh? How retarded and/or brainwashed by

The weirdest thing about this specific case is that the suicide was committed
just an hour after the arrest. Moreover, the woman was suspected of stealing
someone’s phone which is quite not a reason for getting to her account.

"Amandla Stenberg: Black Female Bodies Are Treated As Less Than Human

“Do black females lives matter, too?”

That's the big question 16-year-old Amandla Stenberg posed on Instagram on
Sunday. The powerful post broke down the cultural double standards that
plague black women every day.

“Black features are beautiful, black women are hot,” Stenberg wrote. “White
women are paragons of virtue and desire, black women are objects of
fetishism and brutality. This, at least, seems to be the mentality surrounding
black femininity and beauty in a society built upon eurocentric beauty
standards.”

Everybody knows that racism is alive and prospering in America. However, all
the news about killing black men and black teenagers, police brutality, unfair
sentences and other issues, distract us from the fact that black women are
being abused in the most violent ways. Usually they can't stand up for
themselves unlike men, so they endure and suffer.

In modern America black women experience more depression than probably
during slavery, when everything was obvious, but now racism is hidden

Lee joined NPR this week to defend the bill, basically admitting that all it does
is enable anti-gay discrimination.

Lee framed his concern as one about the government discriminating against
religious institutions — for discriminating against people in same-sex
marriages. It’s the latter he wants to allow by ensuring that the government
never penalizes any religious institution that refuses to recognize a same-sex
couple’s marriage, or employ them, house them, or serve them.

Mr. Lee, you are ridiculous! You're just going to have to get over that fact that

Three days after the Confederate battle flag was ceremonially removed from

buildings, parks and lands.

The USA is out of balance now. We loose our history! The gays, lesbians and

"A number of refugees has increased since Obama became the President

States across the country were filled with flows of refugees since Obama
became the President. The US. refugee admissions database wrapsnet.org
states that 437,829 new refugees came to the USA since Obama first took
office. Most of them were placed in Texas (46,351), California (44,162) and
New York (26,293). Many of refugees were placed in Ohio (14,855), Florida
(21,613), Virginia (9,395), Colorado (11,300) and Nevada (3,421).

Such active provision of a shelter for refugees sooner or later will lead to the
fact that the number of terrorist attacks in the USA will increase. The US
Homeland Security Committee considers that the administration is admitting
too many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps
new terrorist attacks won’t be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more
terrorist attacks if the immigration policy won’t be tightened.

"The spread of hatred in the American society

On Saturday there were two protests: a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina
and an anti-racism protest. About 2,000 people arrived to South Carolina’s
statehouse. Some of them present the KKK’s rally against the removal of the
Confederate flag, while others were from the New Black Panther party and
Black Lives matter groups, holding the Republic of New Afrika flag.

It is a very Clear signal for the federal government that the protest obtains a
systematic and ideological basis. The Klan wanted to underline the traditional
heritage of the Confederate flag. Black protesters, on the contrary stand
against racism. There were also many anti-racism supporters of other races.
The main problem is hatred which is spread among our society. The
government does nothing to solve the matter. If America is a land of free, we
should Clear our country of racism. But on the other hand we shouldn’t refuse

After eight years on the job, Margie V\ﬁnters was fired as director of religious

been married for all eight years.

Unfortunately LGBT teachers have long understood that openly expressing
their identity in school can make them an easy target for discrimination. It is
the biggest mistake!

When students perceive that they’re not supposed to talk about
homosexuality, they conclude that there must be something wrong about
being gay. And it’s a dangerous message that can lead to bullying and
harassment.

Gay teachers need to serve as example for kids! It’s very powerful both for
straight students and for LGBT students to know that they have teachers and
people they respect who are LGBT and who are good at theirjobs. It’s
important for all students to see that nothing to be ashamed! And it must be
illegal for employers to discriminate against employees based on their actual
or perceived sexual orientation!"

So, a family from Moseley, Virginia was threatened at gunpoint for waving the

own driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the
driveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family.

“He slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a
gun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn’t worth anything now,”
Mark Wilson said.

When one spits upon the law because he thinks that it’s amoral, it is
beginning a chaos. Liberals want to ban a confederate flag because slavery
was in the 18th and 19th centuries. They don’t want to understand that
slavery was legal in many countries of the world, but nobody wants to ban a
flag of England or France.

Activists and groups like the NAACP are also calling for statues and
monuments to Confederate leaders to be demolished, including the carving at
Stone Mountain, the largest bas relief sculpture in the world. Some are even
demanding that Washington, DC be renamed in the name of political
correctness because George Washington owned slaves.

Liberals actually want to destroy American history and culture. Americans
should be guided by the law, because sometimes moral is not Clear. If
somebody thinks that the Democratic party is amoral, nobody demands to
eliminate the party.

A teenager shot by City police is paralyzed below the waist, his mother said

This time, a firearm in the hand of her son, Brandon Claxton, 16, prompted an
officer to shoot him three times about 7:15 pm. Saturday in a housing
complex in the 2500 block of Hodiamont Avenue, officials said. Police
encountered him while responding to a call about someone with a stolen

One of three witnesses interviewed Sunday told a reporter that Brandon did
have a gun in his hand. But all three said that he did not point a weapon at
anyone as he tried to run from officers.

"90-year-old VWVII veteran is evicted on stretcher.

The VWVII veteran Johnnie H. Hodges refused to leave his house after he was
not able to pay his mortgage while caring for his sick wife. Police and
ambulance workers had to carry him away on a stretcher.

A 90-year-old Navy veteran lived in his Buffalo home with his wife for
decades. But about four years ago, he was taking care of his wife, who had
Alzheimer’s disease and spent all his income on her rehabilitation. In the
process, he defaulted on his mortgage and amassed a huge debt totaling
$73,000 to M&T Bank. Unfortunately, due to his default on his mortgage loan
payments, he was evicted from his house on a stretcher.

Why does the US. government treat military veterans absolutely
disgracefully? Why the VWVII veterans are literally being treated like human
garbage by their own government? How potentially disabled veteran was
evicted from his house? How come homelessness and unemployment among
American veterans is much higher today than for the general population of the

"The Census Bureau published the new data in its International Data Base,
which contains population estimates and projections up to the year 2050. The
figure from the Census Bureau is a calculation of net migration—meaning the
total number of immigrants who will arrive in the United States in 2015 would
actually be larger than 1.24 million.

Of course, the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had
huge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage, today
there is a jobs deficit. Today the government must restrict immigration that is
a reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate
fuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low
wages. So, besides social problem, immigrants threaten the US. economy.
Those who work illegaly don’t pay taxes that are an important part of state

budget. Working illegaly, they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions
increases crime rates.

Moreover, more and more immigrants cannot speak English. One-fifth of
people in the United States speak a foreign language at home, according to a
report of the Center for Immigration Studies.

You see, increasing ammount of immigrants in the United States creates
social and economic problems. However, we have a risk not only to worsen
the US. economy, but also to lose our culture. America can’t be the Tower of
Babel, we cannot allow everybody to live here if immigration threatens us. We
don’t hate foreigners, we are glad to see tourists from every corner of the
world, but we cannot allow them to stay here.

"Remember when African Americans couldn't drink from the same drinking
fountains as whites? Remember when gay people couldn't get married? Both
scenarios sound so ridiculous.

Especially when you think about how much money is to be gained if same-sex
couples are legally allowed to get married.

A majority of small business owners believe companies shouldn’t be allowed
to withhold goods or services from lesbian, gay,bisexual or transgender
people based on an owner’s religious beliefs, according to a survey released
Monday.

Of course marriage is good for the business - no matter who it is that is
marrying. It's a billion dollar industry in our country!

I am certain that if a state supported marriage for all, then business would
flourish. No one would be offended by not being considered legitimate, when
their feelings are legitimate."
"On the national level, the suicide risk for gay, lesbian and transgender youth
is far higher than it is among straight youth.

LGBTQ youth require medical attention for suicide attempts at a 5.1 times

New York City has agreed to pay the estate of Eric Garner $5.9 million to
settle a lawsuit over his death after he was placed in a Chokehold by a New
York Police Department officer.

The City didn’t admit fault in the settlement, the comptroller’s office said in

million Monday and the Garner family, in his office, agreed unanimously to
end the case.

“There is no amount of money that would compensate them for their loss,”
Mr. Moore said. “Eric Garner is dead. He had no reason to die on that day.
Whatever you think he was doing, he shouldn’t have died.”

Yeah right, money won't bring Eric back. He's gone forever, and his his family

"'THAT'S NOT WHAT I AM': TRANSGENDER PERSON FIGHTS TO
CHANGE 'F' TO 'M' ON DRIVER'S LICENSE.
One of the friends of our group shared his story with us! He has been
discriminated against by local authorities in Louisville, Ky.

There's a gap between Kentucky law and federal law. People trying to Change
the gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery.

But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical
reasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these
people’s Circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats.

It is very important for every transgender to be able to Change his\her
identification to reflect who they really are. It’s not just about person dressed
as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is
about much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man
or woman on|y presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they
were assigned to at birth.

Transgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification
Changes. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible.
Because it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you
were assigned to at birth.

injustice and inequality!

"SOLDIER SHANE.
Recently Pentagon confirmed plan to lift ban on transgender military service.
Let’s meet the big player in repealing the ban.

Sergeant Shane Ortega, 28, doesn't stand out or appear out of the ordinary
among his fellow Army soldiers.
But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first

openly trans soldier of the US Army.

He’s astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (Check out his
muscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee,
he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he
gets giddy talking about both video games and shopping wood in Alaska.

Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has
been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army
paperwork, he is identified as a woman.

But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for
the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded!

America's military progressing s|ow|y towards inclusion and equal opportunity.
Let’s hope that these changes“ ensure peace, instead of waging more war.

"Made In The US: The Justice Turns lnto Business

For years, inmates with non-violent felonies and misdemeanor Charges in
New York City had to sit in Rikers Island for months awaiting trial, 'Cause they
couldn’t afford to pay bail.

Under the City’s new bail initiative announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio last
week, some 3,000 low-level offenders are eligible for release without bail. The
system needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department,
the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or
disorderly conduct.

The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit
with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what
should we do?

The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be Changed. The worse, it
is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep
people in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a
business.

The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government
will start to sell indulgences soon.

Our system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative
solutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and
potentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail!

Lemme ask you, have you ever seen a one of the tobacco industry executives
go to jail? I guess no. We also have never seen the Bush or any other
Presidents administrations were brought to justice.

America has a justice system that was supplanted the Jim Crow laws as a
means to keep the minorities from developing real opportunities for keeping
the very rich from ever being brought to justice."

"No national outrage for an incident at pool party where a black teen was shot
to death

Today, the pool party in Georgia is even more shocking than a recent pool
party in Texas. A young man from Georgia was shot to death at a pool party
at Fayette. It was an advertised on social 200 teenager’s pool party which
ended up with shootings of unknown assailant for unknown reasons. One of
the five injured, a 19-year-old black teenager CIanton passed away on the
way to hospital.

In fact, the media has not made a transparent effort to cover up the incident.
Why the pool party in Georgia is a silent story? Why the police was not aware
of a large party? Why this story has no national outrage? Is it ok when a black
teenager dies?

Unfortunately, the responding police officers were not able to prevent the
tragedy. From these facts one might conclude, police officers know the
easiest ways to arrest people, but they are irresponsible to avoid the
shootings at the average pool party."

On Sunday evening, hours after Emanuel AME. Church opened its doors for

thousands in Charleston took to the streets in a show of support and
solidarity.

Observers on the bridge, and thousands more at the base, joined hands to
create a ""unity chain,"" then held a moment of silence that lasted five minutes
in honor of the fallen.

Police estimated that 10,000 to 15,000 took part in Sunday’s gathering,
according to the Post and Courier. Cars drove slowly past the bridge, taking in
the sight and honking horns in solidarity as people chanted “Charleston
strong!”

Throughout history people start to unite only when they face danger or when
they're in times of great sorrow. Modern America is accustomed to meet only
imaginary dangers, however, Americans are getting more and more reasons
to sorrow over something day by day.

Does it mean that the key to the unity of 330 million Americans is constant
fear and unending sorrow? Does it mean that only this can make Americans
unite and forget about the infighting and differences? Unfortunately, yes, it

Tupac Shakur was indeed not just one of the greatest rappers of all time but a
worldly icon whose status in hip-hop culture can never be replaced. His
revolutionary knowledge mixed with street experience made him powerful
unstoppable force that spoke to the hearts of millions of people. His songs
touch on a number of engaging topics, including religion, women, oppression,
etc. 2Pac was a humanitarian, who stood up for those who couldn’t stand up
for themselves. He believed in Fight and Speaking the Truth.

Nowadays a lot of singers, both black and white use their music to sell
records, just for making money. American society at all levels became too
corruptive, starting from our government and ending with ordinary Citizens. On
the contrary Tupac did his music to influence the world. That’s why he spoke
to issues of poverty, oppression and racism.

Today young African-Americans have fallen under bad influence of money,
drugs and so on. Yeah, it is all started from the government’s attitude
towards Blacks. But let’s remember Tupac and his ability to question the
social order. Changes, one of his popular songs, asks everyone to Change
their lifestyles for better society. He always asked people to share with each
other and to learn to love each other."

intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy and

racism because he has other issues, political calculations. He's the president
of all America, not just black America.‘ We know he's president of all America

West is right as usual. African minorities would Choose Mr. West in 2009 and

"NOM’S LAST ATTEMPT TO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE
National Organization for Marriage is asking all of the GOP presidential
candidates to sign an anti-equality pledge. Let’s take a look at just how crazy
this pledge gets.

That’s just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional
amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last
decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55
percent!

But they don’t stop there. NOM also wants candidates to “work to overturn
any Supreme Court decision” in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants
the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at
this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that
supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn’t qualified to be a judge.

Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken Civil rights laws, creating
loopholes to let companies and Citizens to discriminate if they Cite a religious
justification. That could actually happen — and it already has in some states —
so it’s a huge concern.

And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment
against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are
harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated
from theirfamilies, but I really hope soon there’ll be NO MORE of it!

There’s a part of me that feels very sad for NOM’s fanatics. When they
finally kick the bucket, they’ll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly
face it or not) that their Life’s Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they
worked for made anyone’s life better. At all.

They didn’t win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable.
And when they’re dead and gone, they’ll be remembered only as footnotes
in shameful history — or more likely they ‘ll be forgotten completely.

"Only 9 days this year nobody was killed by police

According to data from Mapping Police Violence there are only 9 days this
calendar year when nobody was killed by police in the USA. Since January 1,
2015 at least 508 people have now been killed by policemen. Moreover,
analyzing all deaths caused by police, African-Amerioan and Hispanic people
are more likely to be killed than Whites. Figures show that the index of deaths
for black people is 3.45 per million, while for whites it is 1.26 per million. Add
here military-style equipment and non-lethal weapons, given to cops.

And only 0.02 per cent of the nation’s police forces are investigated each
year. Only 0.02! That means, US policemen are immune from criminal
Changes in their killings. That’s why they carry out their daily police raids to
destroy the population at the territories under their control."

"The violent pool story #3. White police officer slammed black teen against his
car

This black family from Ohio will never forget the June 9th. According to the
family‘s testimony, Krystal Dixon and her sister Maya Dixon took their eight
Children, nephews and nieces to Ohio public school in a Fairfield.
Nevertheless, the pool employee demanded the family to leave due to one of
the Children did not have swim trunks. One of the boys broke the rules and
the staff asked the family to leave. As six-months pregnant Krystal Dixon
walked to the parking lot, the police officer grabbed her arm and asked for an
ID-oard. The witness video shows how the police officer pepper sprayed
Dixon‘s family and grabbed 12-year-old Child by neck. But according to the
Fairfield police department, the white police officer did not use excessive
force.

Did the pool staff force them to leave because they were black? Was it a race
factor? Don‘t you think the police officer‘s attempt to arrest Krystal Dixon was
unlawful? How the police officers should be Charged? What kind of right of
defense do you have against unlawful arrests?

These days, there is far more to being a “good cop” than Choosing not to hurt
innocent people. Plus, when are we going to stop being stereotypical? Even
today, the stereotypes effect black population of the United States of America

"A small group of activists burned two confederate flags in response to
shooting in Charleston, South Carolina.

Why the symbol of the pro-slavery rebellion is still flying on the ground of
South Carolina? Why the symbol of white supremacy is still flying on the
South Carolina statehouse in Columbia? Why the flag that represents the
murder of blacks was not removed from the national statehouse?

The confederate flag represents terrorism, reminding us about the slavery
time, racism and people that were murdered in a hate-crime. Today, we ask
to remove this symbol of racism that flies 120 miles away from the Emanuel
African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.

Yes, we must wipe off every single symbol of racism from the United States of
America including the confederate flag, KKK and other racist organizations.
We must give new names to the streets which were named after racist
political figures and slave traders. We must remove monuments dedicated to
Andrew Jackson, Robert Lee, Benjamin Huger, James Longstreet who owned
slaves on their farms.

How can we ever expect to get the racist symbols removed until we show
ourselves to be men the same as any other race of men?"
"Sadness and shocking tragedy at historically black Church in Charlestone
*CLICK TO GET LIVE UPDATES ON OUR PAGE*

A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other Church members at black
Church in Charlestone, SC on Wednesday night. The young Clean-shaved
shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people.
Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be
investigated as hate crime.

Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American Church which was
found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822.

Despite the first black American president, Africa-Amerioans remain the most
common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to
xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage
that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms
take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we
think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for
Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last
February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from
the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate
and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-Crimes?

What if American racial Change sti|| occurs through generations? What of it

"A woman pretended Afro—American to gain control over black community
association

The president of a local NAACP Chapter in Spokane, Washington is under
investigation after her parents publicly accused her of lying being African
American. Both parents of Rachel Dolezal are white. Rachel Dolezal also
serves as the Chair of Spokane's Office of Police Ombudsman Commission
and is an adjunct professor of Africana Studies at Eastern Washington
University. Dolezal falsely identified herself as African-American in order to be
appointed as a Chair. Dolezal's parents paid attention to the official
documents, including a birth certificate, confirming that Rachel is part
Swedish, Czech, and German with ""traces"" of Native American heritage.

We see, how whites are trying to gain control over traditionally black
organization that protects the rights and interests of the black community. In
the Dolezal’s case it is unlikely it was a mistake or personally motivated
fraud. Simply she was given a task to join the association of black community
in order to control it and hold the interests of white majority.

We need a deep inspection of Rachel Dolezal’s activities while she was a
president of the local branch of the Association of black people! In order not to
repeat similar cases in future we need a careful control of all appointments by

after getting permission from league officials, the staff and the students of the
Beaumont Bulls football team took a knee before their game. On the next day,
the students and the staff received death threats. Moreover, the executive
board decided to suspend Coach RahORah Barber for the rest of the season
and canceled the whole football season. So now we know what opposition
might face in this country."

"Fellow Texans! It's time to say a strong NO to the establishment robbers. It is
unacceptable for us to see them ruin all we've been building for decades. For
centuries. The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but
they are wrong. We won’t put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does
not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it
mention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some
outdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a
victory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no.
We are free citizens of Texas and we’ve had enough of this Cheap show on
the screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and
gun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but
not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher
taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist
attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let’s remind them
what Texas is made of and show that we’re ready to SECEDE!

Use our page to team up with other locals. Invite your friends and family,
spread the word and let's make this effort together! Get Ready to Secede!"

The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans’ issues was
in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans’ life
improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are
some real Clinton decisions:

—Last year, Clinton Claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had
been exaggerated by Republicans.

—In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007
supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans’

medical care.
-In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20

million for veterans’ health care facilities.
-In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for “$13 billion
for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.”

In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the
poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the
issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they
need so bad!

"Young, Unarmed Black Man Killed By Cop Didn't Want To 'Die Too Young'

An unarmed black teenager in Texas was shot dead by a cop who had only
recently graduated from the police academy. Just over a week before his
death, he posted that he doesn't want to die too young on Twitter.

Officers responded to a burglary call around 1 am. on Friday, hearing reports
that a suspect was damaging vehicles. First spotting Taylor moving about the
lot, officers also noticed Taylor's SUV had been smashed into the front of the
dealership showroom. Finding that Taylor had moved inside the showroom,
Arlington Police Chief Police Will Johnson said Taylor would not comply when
told to lie down on the ground, but fled to a back room. 49-year-old officer
Brad Miller entered the showroom to arrest Taylor, and then an altercation
broke out. Miller fired four shots, including the fatal bullets from the gun of
Miller. A second officer fired a taser, Johnson said.

And now there are three main points that you should think of:

1) Taylor was described as a good kid. He was a football player at Angelo
State University. Never was involved in criminal activities.

2) The officer graduated from the police academy less than 6 months ago and
was working under the supervision of a training officer.

3) Taylor didn't want to die young.

Black teens don't really live, they survive. And, unfortunately, there is no one

to save them from death. There is no one to stop police brutality. We all want
our kids to feel safe, we want them to be safe and sound. Are our hopes

doomed to disappointment?"
"Silenced racism in America

Tamir Rice, Rumain Brisbon, Kajieme Powel, Dante Parker, Michael Brown,
John Crawford III, Eric Garner, Jonathan Ferrell, Kimani Gray, Michael Brown
and Sandra Bland are one of many examples of excessive police brutality
used on black Americans.

You never know if a simple traffic stop will end up with you in a police custody
or bullets in your Chest.

Unfortunately, many of Americans feel very uncomfortable talking about these
issues, which seem to confirm the idea that the government remain silent.
Nevertheless, one should accept that African-Americans are more likely to be
targeted by police officers on the street than whites. Therefore it endangers
the rights of black community.

Doubtless when the government defends the officers who have killed black
men, it strikes us how unfair the system is and reaffirms our view that America
would spend billions of dollars on radical extremists than talking about the
domestic terrorism, racial inequality and police brutality."
"The Civil Rights Activist Mary McLeod Bethune

Mary McLeod Bethune was the Civil rights activist and an educator who found
the National Council of Negro Women in 1935. Being one of the 17 Children of
former slaves she was the first and the only Child to go to African-Amerioan
school. She found the Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute for Negro Girls
because she believed that education was the key to racial advancement. In
addition, Bethune did a lot of work to contribute to American society. For
instance, she was the president of the Florida Chapter of the National
Association of Colored Women. Moreover, in 1935 Mary Bethune became an
advisory to President Roosevelt on minority affairs and later on she started
her Civil rights organization, the National Council of Negro Women.

The great educator and Civil right activist Mary McLeod Bethune
demonstrated the values of education, the philosophy of love and the wise
use of power. Sadly, at least 10 years of data reveals that Congress don‘t pay
attention to American Civil rights as Mary McLeod Bethune did 80 years ago."
"Why black parents worry about their Children? How should we talk to our

Children about how safely interact with police officers in order to protect
themselves?

Tina Carter—Shileds has five kids and three of them recently started to drive.
The first thought she had when they wanted to drive alone was 'Wait a
minute. I'm really scared right now.' What should they do if they get pulled
over? What if they do something they don‘t supposed to be doing? It is not
always fair when officers arrest African Americans, but it‘s a reality. What if

police officers will automatically assume that your Child is criminal because of
how him or her looks.

Black parents should remember that their kids will always be judged by the
way they look. That‘s why it‘s important to instruct our Children how to react
when you are in trouble with law enforcement. Because if a stranger follows
your Child after him/her buy a bag of Skittles, ran back into the store.
Remember, anything is better than dying.

Anyways, it‘s hard to believe that in 21st century black parents have to teach

their Children both survive and thrive. But who will take responsibility for
training police officers?"

most influential LGBT roles throughout his acting career.

The 63-year-old comedian, who had struggled with depression, died by
suicide on August 11 2014.

His widow Susan Schneider said at the time of his death: “As he is
remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin’s death, but on the
countless moments ofjoy and laughter he gave to millions.”

Even at home, Williams exhibited acceptance for the LGBT community with
his trademark playfulness.

While he denied rumours about being gay, he had no qualms about
discussing the sexuality of his pet pug.

He said: “I also have a gay rescue pug called Leonard. He has a boyfriend
and they are planning to adopt a Siamese kitten together. We’re very
modern.”

When the Westboro Baptist announced its intentions to picket his funeral, pro-
LGBT organisation Planting Peace raised over $40,000 for St. Jude

Isn’t it just amazing? Wonder Woman presides over the wedding of two
brides in Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman, Chapter 48 written

and illustrated by Jason Badower.
Badower said he also really wanted to reference current affairs in the story -

specifically, legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide.

""I saw this Wonder Woman story as an incredible opportunity to have one of
the most recognizable, iconic Characters in the world to be among the first to
step forward and officially endorse this new law,"" he said. ""I thought, let's not
just have Wonder Woman embrace this new law, let's have her celebrate it.""

Some may ask — why is it so important when superheroes depicted as
supporters of marriage equality? Because it is a massive, land-mark

milestone in LBGTQ rights history.

Because the fight to get to normal was so difficult, and because the fight to
Change normal is still ongoing. Just like Wonder Woman using her

problematic in terms of lack of transparency and accountability. For instance,
one candidate is complicit in fueling the war on drugs; another one in

"The threat of possible ISIS attacks on the US. Military families has risen

US. Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado said in a statement
that he was alarmed by the reports of an FBI alert that relatives of the US
military personnel in Wyoming and Colorado were harassed outside their
homes by Middle Eastern men and might have been under surveillance. A
copy of the alert said that the wife of a US. military member was approached
in front of her home in Colorado by two men. The incident took place in May.
Similar incidents in Wyoming repeated in June.

We see that the threat of possible ISIS attack on families of the US. military
has risen. And when the threat is so real the US intelligence agencies are
doing nothing. As a matter of the fact they don’t fully perform their duties.
First of all, the US security forces should take all appropriate measures to
identify people who scour after the wives and Children of the US. Military.
Secondly, families of the US. Military should be taken under special
protection of the police and the FBI. If even one hair of the US. Military family
members will be lost then the work of American secret services isn’t worth a
dime as they cannot maintain security on the American soil. In case of a
negative scenario there won’t be any need in their work. And this will be the
final nail in the coffin of the American secret services.

Let’s remember the last FBI and NSA failures, such as failure to stop the
Boston Marathon Bombings and so on. Our soldiers fight for America at the

was trying to escape from a house where officers were carrying out a search
warrant for him. The 33-year-old and 20-year-old officers who shot the
suspect four times were about seven years on the force.

That was followed by crowd of 150 people who gathered by intersection. Later
on, nine people were arrested on Charges of resisting arrest. The protesters
said that the police provoked the situation. What do you think about it? What if
this situation makes us want to keep the police out of our neighborhood? Why
do you think police shoots first and then asks questions? Do you realize that
the shooting came just ten days after St. Louis was flooded with protesters
who were marking the anniversary of Michael Brown? What if the City and the
government needs to center its attention on racism and discrimination in
America instead of suspecting every single black men?

We cannot accept the fact that police can easily kill black people in America,
than we must do something about it. Protest or accept it. You Choose. This is

"Special prosecutor opened an investigation into death of black women
Raynette Turner

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman will launch an investigation
into to the death of one of the five black women who died in an American jail
over a two-week span. Raynette Tumer who was the mother of eight Children
died in jail cell in police custody last week. She was arrested for shoplifting
some crab legs from a grocery store. Due to her bad health history she was
taken to the hospital and released. But she died in jail waiting for someone to

help.

According to American legislation, the courthouse officials are supposed to
Check the cell every fifteen minutes but, no one Checked Tumer‘s cell for
more than two hours.

A total of five African-Amerioan women have been found dead in police
custody in just the last month. Most of them were hold for minor Charges and
still their deaths are under investigation. Sandra Bland from Texas, Kindra
Chapman from Alabama, Joyce Curnell from South Carolina, Ralkina Jones
from Ohio, and Raynetta Turner from New York were found dead in their cell
after being arrested by police officers.

Once again it raises questions about how black people are treated in police
custody. What if death in police custody is about excessive police force? Do
you realize that dozens of black people were found dead in the US?"
"Who said that protesting is not effective? Yes, it is!

How many black people were killed and shot by police department for the

According to analysis by AP, 24 states have put 40 new laws to tackle police
violence such as use of police officer body cameras, raciaI-bias training and
surplus of military equipment. However, there is more work to be done to
solve racial tensions in America.

The public stand against discrimination happens when there is lack of inside
connections with the government. People attempt to stop racism the
government usually assumes to be problematic but protesters force the

government to find compromise. It‘s a well known fact, when governments do
not deliver, people protest."
"BREAKING NEWS! #Oakland #JoeBart

Oakland police officers fatally shot a man suspected in alleged carjaoking
attempt in Downtown Oakland Wednesday night. Is it a race war?

Yesterday night, a group of 50 protesters burned Confederate flag and tried to
shutdown a freeway in Downtown Oakland. The opposition to police violence
was in response to the police shooting earlier in the day.

According to Oakland Police Department, yesterday at 2:39 pm. in the area
of 69th Avenue and International Boulevard, Oakland police officers spotted a
vehicle they believe to be connected to a previous robbery on July 27. The
pursuit started when the driver fled through Oakland streets until the suspect
crashed into another car in the area of 27th Avenue and Martin Luther King
Jr. street. But when the suspect ran of the car, three officers opened fire. The
suspect Joe Bart has died at the hospital.

Did you know that it was fifth shooting this year that involved police officers?

"Ex-Ferguson Cop Darren Wilson: Incident 'Makes Me Unemployable'

I bet you remember the white former officer who shot and killed an unarmed
black teen in Ferguson, last August? After national debate over the
relationship between police and black communities Darren Wilson aka ""Bad

turned down because he's too big a liability.

In the recent interview to New Yorker magazine he said, ""It's too hot an issue,
so it makes me unemployable.""

So what does the situation mean to America?

Almost nothing except one thing... a man's life may be ruined because he had
the audacity to defend himself against huge man with malicious intent.
Michael Brown was a thug, who had just assaulted a store owner, and robbed
him. Do you have any idea what should police officer do in such situation? He
must stop the criminal, period. He was in a no-win situation and it proves how
upside-down society has become.

I wonder, what will be the next step of American justice degradation? Will
surgeons be fired for operate patients with knives? Will Supreme Court send
teachers to jail for teaching?

Instead hate Wilson, we should pray for him. He did nothing wrong but idiots
turned society against an innocent man. So is it a new America?"

pending applications for health care had already died.

Well, this story Clearly demonstrates what value for the state the life of a man

"Most parents aren’t prepared for the words, “Mom, Dad. I’m gay.” For many
parents first reaction probably will be “How will I ever handle this?” The
answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help
to understand your Child’s sexuality and its meaning to you and your
continued relationship with your son or daughter.

Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their
Child’s sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as
problem-free — overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during
that time.

Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening — by rejecting what they're
hearing (“It’s just a phase; you’ll get over it”); by shutting down (“If you
Choose that lifestyle, I don’t want to hear about it”); or by not registering the
impact of what we’re being told (“That’s nice, dear, and what do you want

for dinner?”).

Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT Children. If
you as a parent 'll pretend to forgot the truth about your child’s sexuality, you
would never really know your Child. A large part of his or her life would be kept
secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person.

It is important to accept and understand your child’s sexuality because
homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment
for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of
telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"".

On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding
and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you’re wondering, “ls
she/he sure?” the answer will almost always be “yes”!

35-mile trek to Washington has started this Sunday evening in order to bring
more attention to widespread violence in different Cities across America. The
founder of the group Munir Bahar said that the march will last 20 hours in a
memory of more than 200 people who have been killed in Baltimore this year.
The 300 Men March will highlight the racism and violence across the country.

What‘s wrong with our society? Police kill unarmed Citizens, we kill each
other. What example we will be setting for the future generations? How are
we going to break the cycle of violence? Are there any Chances to overcome
deeply rooted racism and violence in America? What if peace comes after the
fairness?"
"Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, it doesn’t matter. Racism is racism, it’s wrong
regardless."
"Prominent Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King revealed to be white

Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King has Claimed for years that he is
biracial, being born to a white mother and a black father. But recently
uncovered records Claim he misled the public about his race, and that he is in
fact a white man pretending to be black.

King’s race would not be under scrutiny if it was not an essential component
of his career, education and social status. In addition to getting a full-ride
scholarship that is exclusively for black men, King has the position of “Justice
Columnist” at progressive news website Daily Kos and enjoys a
169,000-strong follower count on Twitter, most of whom are a result of his
activism following the death of Mike Brown in Ferguson.

King still did not directly answer the simple yes or no question about his ethnic
background: Are you black? Instead, he said, “If you have known me from
when l was in elementary school at Huntertown Elementary until now, you’ve
known me as black or bi-racial.”

Turning blackness into a performance is anti-blackness—irrespective of
whether the white person doing it is Rachel Dolezal or Shaun King."
"Three Bronx officers were caught on camera by the passenger in a car as the
driver appears to be repeatedly punched in the head and thrown to the

“Y’all is punching me in the face. What did I do to deserve this?” the
24-year-old Timothy Nelson can be heard saying in the recording of the July
26 traffic stop.

Do they really need 20 cops showing up for a traffic stop? And that's why I’d
rather call a crack head for help before I call the cops ..... they don't protect and
serve, they shoot and kill anybody that's not wearing a police badge. And I do
not wear it."

"A heavily armed Syed Farook, his wife and brother opened fire on a holiday
banquet for his co-workers Wednesday, killing 14 people and seriously
wounding more than a dozen others in a precision assault. Hours later, two
terrorists died in a shootout with San Bernardino police. One shooter still at
large.

It is known that gunmen are Muslims. They are very religious and probably
linked with ISIS. California shooting should become a lesson for the
administration — accepting refugees from Syria threatens the National
security.

It’s tragedy. Enemies of America attacked our people again. Unfortunately,
today we have no strong leader who is courageous enough to conquer
terrorism. Nevertheless, we will not allow terrorists to Change our way of life.
We will not allow them to restrict our freedoms.

"ANOTHER BLACK MAN MURDERED IN POLICE CUSTODY. THINGS
HAVE BEEN VERY SILENT ON HIS BEHALF

The 31-year-old black man died Feb. 20 at Fairfield Medical center after he
had a “medical episode” at the jail when deputies were moving Ariel J. Clark
from one cell to another. According to police reports, Arial J. Clark, 31, was
too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest.

On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark, reporting
that Clark, who was driving his wife and two Children from Buffulo to Texas,
was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark‘s wife said that a man and his
son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he
hadn‘t slept in five days. When the police arrived, Clark was arrested, taken
to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint Chair for his
combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some
breathing difficulties and deputies started Chest compression. But an hour
later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital.

An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail
inmate.

Now the question is whether the jail‘s standard operating procedures were
followed.

We would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after “fighting” with
the police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at
hospital. For now the only thing we know is that another black man died in
police custody."

Dear Mrs. Clinton,

We are trying not to be political, but the current presidential elections and the

rise of hate against Muslims made us realize that it is time to stand and let our
voices be heard.

We know that you defend American Muslims now in your presidential
campaign, but did you support us before campaign?

We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and
Americans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused
hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their
homes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women
and Children, to die in their homes, and for what?

Libya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill A|-
Gaddafi. You said in an interview: ""We came, we saw, he died"". Let's not
forget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security,
and that caused the death of the US. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens
and US. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and
CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were
also injured in the attacks.

You killed Saddam Hussein and Al-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the
countries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat
not only to the US. but the whole world!

You are supporting gun control, disarming the American Citizens and at the
same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders,
creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq,
Afghanistan and Syria.

8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years
ago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it. You Change
your views very fast. You speak as a democrat and act as a republican. Sorry,
but you can not be our representer, you can not be the president of the United
States.

Sincerely,
United Muslims of America"

"The liberal mass media tried to overblow a story about the KKK’s
endorsement of Trump. They Claimed Donald is supported by David Duke and
“white supremacists”. The journalists are trying to depict Trump as a racist
and continue their attempts even after Trump officially declared “I don’t know
anything about David Duke... You’re asking me a question that I’m supposed
to be talking people I know nothing about.”

However, “for some reasons” the same mass media in their revelation
campaign forgot to mention Hillary Clinton’s ties to Robert Byrd, a former
KKK leader. Hillary described him as a man of “surpassing eloquence and
nobility”. In 2010 after Byrd died she released a tribute video saying “It is
almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd.
He was not just its longest-serving member; he was its heart, its soul, and its
historian. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he
was always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless
advocacy for his West Virginia constituents, his fierce defense of the
Constitution, and the traditions of the Senate, and his passion for a
government that improves the lives of the people it serves.”

So here the mass media give us an political paradox: a Republican candidate
can’t be endorsed by a former KKK member, but a Democrat can easily show
her respect and honor to a former racist leader without being judged for that.
Isn’t that a little hypocritical?"

gold mine, extracting huge sum of money from Civilians. You can be put
behind bars if you fail to comply with the demands. Suddenly one’s life
becomes tattered when jail comes in, because there is no freedom of making
a better living. Federal prosecutors should shake up and hold judges and all

of money or put someone behind bars because he/she couldn’t pay a fine.

"Religious leaders joined local organizations in rallying support for two men
who said they were attacked outside a convenience store this weekend in
what police are investigating as a possible hate crime.

Authorities are reviewing surveillance video of the reported attack, which
occurred shortly after 3 am. Saturday at the Kwik Shop at 4820 E. 21st St.
That’s just northeast of the Wichita State University campus.

One of the victims was Khondonkor Usama, Muslim 23, the second victim, is
a 19-year-old student who has Chosen to remain anonymous.

They were getting gas and snacks at about 3 am. Saturday when they
noticed a man shouting at someone who had apparently asked him for gas
money.

When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him
for money, one of the students attempted to intervene.

The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his
motorcycle in front of Usama’s car and approaching Usama’s friend, who
had gotten out of the car.

The suspect called his friend “brown trash” and told him he had to “leave this
country,”

According to Usama’s account, his friend responded: “This is my country.
Who the hell are you to tell me to leave?”

The incident “escalated really quick,” with the suspect attempting to punch
his friend, Usama said. When he attempted to break up the fight, Usama said
he was assaulted and knocked down.

He called 911, and as he was on the phone the attacker rode Circles around
the two students, Chanting “Trump! Trump! Trump!” and screaming, “We’ll
make America great again! We’ll throw you out of the wall!”"

terrorism for white supremacy, white nationalism and anti-immigration. They
normally aimed at groups whom they opposed. The Klan held an anti-
immigration rally on Saturday. They got surrounded by group of protesters
who beat and kicked them violently. On Monday evening, a crowd of Civil right
protesters gathered for a vigil against Ku Klux Klan. It was a march where the

Through the struggles and pains of losing a dear husband, Nicole Bennett has

"Hillary Clinton made new promises to extend our traitor President Obama’s
pro-immigration policy. She also promised to offer illegals residency and “a
path of citizenship”. During the debate on 8th March she was asked about
deportation.

Clinton said: “I would not deport Children. I do not want to deport family
members either. I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent
criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us. That’s
a relatively small universe.” Oh wonderful, so she admits she wants to be the
second Obama, like the first one isn’t enough. And we know what’s behind
this world “Children” — young men who Claim to be less than 18. Same way
the “illegals without a criminal record” is also those who are not proved to be
criminals yet.

should bring just one simple punishment — deportation and a prohibition of

kills a black Civiliian, and also feels it’s his right to sue the dead because
sympathizers gave him a sleepless night. If it was lawful to kill Quintonio
LeGrier because he was in abnormal state of mind according to the cops,
then we ask, how about the shooting of Bettie Jones? The story is always
rewritten and painted when it comes to dealing with race. Racial disparity and
segregation cannot be overlooked in America. There is too much level of
inhumanity. The cops still things it wasn’t enough killing a mentally
disordered and an innocent woman. He still has the balls to sue even the
dead. This is what living in America is like, if you are black."

"What's the difference between USA cops and EU cops?

That's a fact that US police officers are bad trained. Cops are programmed to
take innocent lives. Cops here in America play God. They believe they are
judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law,
it is theirjob to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot
someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their
eyes.

It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the
difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will
get away with it.

In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand
that theirjob is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,
they understand that they are not the jury and this is not theirjob.

Bad that America trained not like this!???"

"Please take a moment to read my story!

Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of
his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the
ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the
location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on

the passenger's side.

When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the
situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man

"SHOCKING!!! Cops can't stop using their blue privilege for illegal parking.
Could you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she
realized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face
is priceless.

The story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for
illegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who
had towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The
driver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under
threat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125.

The sheriff’s office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11
years and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that
how PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix
the situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer
is to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not
have mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon.

To my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun.
Such cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give
our Citizens a Chance to get back home alive.

According to State Police troopers Darzeil Hall and Lamarr Johnson, ever

Instead of correcting the wrong behavior toward black employees, police
department aggressively criticized their conduct. For instance, police trooper

"MAN WHO WAS CHARGED WITH BURNING DA VINCI APARTMENT WAS
ANGRY ABOUT POLICE KILLINGS OF BLACK PEOPLE

The man who was accused of Da Vinci apartment complex arson that caused
the City $100 million in damages testified that he was angry at high-profile
killing of black men.

Dawud Abdulwali attended a party in a Hollywood hotel where he ranted
about the August 2014 killing of unarmed Michael Brown by a white police
officer in Ferguson. According to one of the witnesses, he was so mad about
the high profile killing of unarmed black men, so he burned the building.

Abdulwalia‘s anger at police was not a good reason to burn down some
apartments, but injustice brought him to this action. Either way, crime should
not be tolerated. But we have to start thinking about the message he was
trying to send: having a black president Changes almost nothing."

higher than what the government gives to Social Security Retirees. According
to a report from the Center for Immigration Studies, the average annual SSA
retirement benefit for legal Citizens is roughly $14,772.

As if that weren’t enough, the proposal also demands another $2.1 billion for

"Horrifying video shows inmate being shocked three times with a stun gun

Recently released video shows the moment officers shot 24-year-old Brandon
Bethea with a stun gun as he was in a jail cell.

Jail officers said Bethea had threatened them and that’s why he was hit with
a stun gun but I guess cops didn't know the camera was recording them.
FIVE OFFICERS stood over Bethea and just watching how Clark pulled the
trigger two more times. As usual, no Charges were ever filed against the
officers involved in Bethea's death.

There is no doubt that Bethea was murdered. Have you noticed that it took 20
minutes passed by before another officer summoned a nurse and they
attempted to revive Bethea. All of bastard cops who were there should be in
prison for murder. America, it's not a black or white problem... but a blue one."

happened the night a Chicago.

The video shows how officers, Michelle Morsi-Murphy and Jose Lopez,
brutalized Rev. Catherine Brown. Brown was driving back home, when Morsi-
Murphy jumped out of the car and approached her yelling curse words and
demanding she move the vehicle back. When Brown reached for her license,
Lopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover, Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor
Brown, who was beat and pepper—sprayed by police. Brown is not the only
victim, her kids had suffered from pepper spray too.

The US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why
the hell they treat us as animals? This will not stop until cops are held

"US. ARMY LIFTS BAN ON DREADLOCKS.

After the critics complained about the Army‘s unfair burden on black women‘s

hair, the US. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in
April 2014.

The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned
braids and twists amidst the criticism.

Some of the female soldiers used harsh Chemicals to keep their hair straight.
Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks
caused a lot of unnecessary stress.

The ban on loos, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until
January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option.
Now the rules allow dreadlocks and looks but only if they are less than a half-
inch wide.

Well, it took months for the Army to recognize that black women have
different hair texture."

he was 9-year-old. She began to take him to local museums such as the
Apex, the Sights and Sounds Black Cultural Museum and the Fernbank
Museum of Natural History.

To improve Leon’s skills of painting he began to attend art Classes of R.
Gregory Christies. Non-profit organization the Southwest Atlanta Youth
Business Organization (SWAYBO) also helped Leon in many ways.
According to blacknews.com, the organization gave him lessons of “poise
and presentation, public speaking, sales and marketing at marketplaces and
how to perform basic accounting formulas. With SWAYBO, Leon has met
judges, successful business owners and other pillars of the Black

community.”
Now Moss makes illustrations and sells the copies of his works. The first book

with his illustrations is As Big As God.

"Drum and Spear Bookstore in Washington DC was opened by veteran
members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in
summer of 1968. The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next
year the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company.
One of co-founders said “We don’t define profit in terms of money. The profit
is the patronage of the community, which allows the store to seIf-support.”
Drum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history,
something beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of
the shop: the drum is for “communications within the diaspora,” and the
spear symbolizes “whatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the
people.”

The best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the
Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver’s Soul on Ice.

This bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores.
Drum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a ""free
spaces"" for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital
issues. Let's not forget our legacy! We need this drum and we need this spear

today, in 2017.

"Those duplicitous politicians say they want to end the war in Syria though all
they do makes the situation worse and leads to more blood spilled in the
Middle East. Unfortunately, many of these hypocrites have infiltrated the
American establishment. Such people benefit from regional conflicts and war
is nothing more than business for them. It was these people who launched the
missiles that never hit no terrorists but led to Civilian casualties. It is them who
keep receiving money from the same actors who sponsor ISIS and other
groups. These people want more American involvement because it means
more money for them and they don’t care about the terrorists. In fact, radicals
really help them increase their bloody income. The only way to resist the
corrupt elites is to oppose military actions with no particular aim and promote
anti-terrorist agenda! Focus on what’s truly important and we will end the war
in Syria sooner than you can imagine."

"Our politicians should never forget that. We’ve been watching our military
commandership wasting lives of American soldiers for too long, let’s hope it
will end now when Trump is in Charge.

A new Marine Corps artillery unit was sent to assist Syrian opposition in
Raqqa, according to Army Maj. Josh T. Jacques, a spokesman for US.
Central Command. The artillery unit recently replaced about 400 Marines from
the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which provided artillery support to Kurdish
and Syrian Arab forces expected to launch an offensive against Raqqa.

We must deal with ISIS and end the terrorist threat once and for all.
Unfortunately that’s hardly possible because of the corruption in the
Government. The Swamp in DC is still not drained from people like Senator
McCain, and that’s why our troops not only focus on defeating terrorism, but
also getting involved into another regime Change venture and possibly
another oil war.

We’re fighting radical Islamists, but we’re also siding with Syrian opposition,
the very same radical Islamists, and there’s absolutely no guarantee that
these rebels won’t replace ISIS when it’s gone.

There’s only one Chance to avoid another Iraq: Trump and the American
nation must defeat globalist politicians and the Establishment. All we can do
now is to pray for all American soldiers to return back home alive and safe."

2015. But what about domestic and State Department spending? For
example, such an increase for the Department of Defense means 31% cut in

"Everyday we watch, read and receive news of police beating, assaulting, and
killing innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common
that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were
wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,
karma's coming back for blue pigs!

A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police
officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two
officers for seemingly no reason.

The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two
school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza
shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of
police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do |itera||y
nothing without using their guns.

Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their
own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with Chemical and
electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing theirjob."" All those things and
more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my
rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.

Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine
about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is
why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our
ancestors did it for centuries.

"In a recent interview, Barack Obama said that not bombing Syria “required
the most political courage”. He said that sending troops to Syria was a very
difficult decision, but not bombing Syria was even harder to make. Obama
was hated for not taking actions, but it’s better for being hated for not killing
innocent people that for starting a useless war.

Though it was tough, Obama did a great job keeping away from the war that
would take millions from the US budget and get innocent people killed.
Unfortunately, the recent government didn’t think twice, before they started
bombing Syria. They will cut the support of Black families in the US to kill
innocent kids in Syria. How did we come to this?!"
Well done! I live for the sake of such exalted moments.

Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom.

opposite to the “America First” concept.

I believe Trump can fix it, just like he promised. Sadly days after days and
weeks after weeks of Trump’s presidency there are no Changes in that
direction. Israel captured a Syrian region named Golan Heights in 1967, and
today this land is internationally considered to be occupied territory. Israelis
want to use Trump’s influence so the world would acknowledge Israeli
sovereignty. Trump is a dealer, and maybe he’s trying make a deal out of it,
but there’s one important thing here: under no Circumstances can our

"I believe Ron Paul’s position on our foreign military policy is absolutely right.
After all, it was Trump who promised to put America First and promised to end
Obama’s policy of wasting budget money on military operations overseas.
“We’re not going into Syria”, Trump said it to calm down those who got really
concerned about a possibility of America getting involved into another war. I
really want to trust these words, but unfortunately many high-ranked
politicians want to force Trump to pull America into another war.

Here’s what Ron Paul thinks about it: “By the end of this month, Defense
Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will
deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan,
Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send
his national security team back to the drawing board — or replace them. There
is no way another “surge” in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria)
puts America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will
succeed any better than it did the last time.”

Syria will be just another oil war; Iraq cost our country 4,500 soldier lives, and
why the hell are we still in Afghanistan? We’ve started the whole Afghanistan
thing to beat the Soviets, and no there’s no Soviet Union on the world map,
and all the communists left on this planet are only Chinese and Californian
students."

On September 4, 2013, a student from the University of Central Florida
Victoria King was pulled over by officer Timothy Isaacs for a bad tail light.
The situation escalated quickly when the police officer demanded King to roll
down her window ""all the way” to receive her ticket. When King refused,
which by the way was a perfectly legal thing to do, the police officer broke out
the car window and arrested her in a brutal way. Instead of simply Citing her,
the police officer demanded the woman to obey and threw her to the ground.
When you're Black no violation is small enough. Every contact with the police

"FINALLY! TWO GEORGIA POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN FIRED AFTER
VIDEO SHOWS THEM KICK BLACK MAN DURING TRAFFIC STOP

Two Georgia police officers have been fired after police released the footage
of the encounter where two Gwinnett County cops kicking a black college
student during a traffic stop.

According to a police report, 21-year-old Demetrius Ho||ins was pulled over
near Lawrenceville for Changing |ines several times without signaling. When
cops stopped him, Ho||ins was seen on video standing with his hands raised
before one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face, and the
second cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Ho||ins in his face.

The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach
him. Ho||ins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn‘t have
anything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the
incident cops wrote in their police report that Ho||ins resisted arrest and
Claimed that Ho||ins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted
arrest. Cops |itera||y lied and had no shame.

This incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law
enforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions. Resignation
is not the answer. We did not hear any criminal Charges, even though they
admit the cops broke the law. Where is the justice? FINALLY! TWO

you for the supportive donation to our schools. As we all know, CPS has been
struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to
where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the
community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to
improve our Chicago...

All of the things that you do for our City never go unnoticed. All of the free
concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the City really show you
care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility
away from artists, but it hasn’t Changed you...

We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others
have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored
and as though we don’t have enough support from bigger influences like you.
Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many
stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers clue to the frequent
violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that
someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You
and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be
successful, still be self-made...

Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the City we
know and love, Chicago.

As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn’t forget
who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people’s love.
That’s cool that this love goes back and forth!

people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day

"Ah immigration judge has ordered an Army veteran from Chicago, who served
two tours of duty, to be deported. His name is Miguel Perez and he is Chicano
in every sense of the word. Perez moved to Chicago when he was 8—years-
old and was a permanent legal resident. He joined the US. Army and served
two tours of duty in Afghanistan where he suffered a brain injury in an
explosion. Perez served seven years, but because he is not a US. citizen,
Immigration Customs Enforcement detained him, stripped his legal status and

began the deportation process.
This system doesn't appreciate our sacrifices. America was designed that

way it will only benefit gringos. Miguel Perez is a real hero, who was betrayed
by America. When will we have real justice in this country?"

why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what?

"New trends. Often “new trends” of American and European cultures is
nothing but reinvention of African legacy. People should pay more attention to
education and history of things. People should know the origins, not to
confuse things. If you want to stress that you use something you taken from
another culture it's one thing. But when you wear (for example) dreadlocks
and don't know anything about its meaning, it can look strange, even weird.
White people do many such things unintentionally. It doesn't make them wise.
Same goes to African Americans who copy white people. Know yourself! We
have beautiful culture and history!

Women's Hall of Fame earlier this month. This is a huge step for a latino
woman in the US. She says: ""Diversity on the bench is so important because
the people that come to court come from all different walks of life, different
ethnic backgrounds, different religious backgrounds.""

However, if it's a sign of diversity, this is a very weak sign. Just think, we are
indigenous inhabitants of this land and we were cut off all privileges since
gabachos came and stole our land. So, it took almost 500 years for our
woman to reach a prestigious position in the government that is not really
caring about us! Whether there are latinos or not, authorities will continue to
deport us from our indigenous land!"

"Meet Joseph Wicks, the man whose biggest dream is to save old house in
downtown Charleston.

Joseph, a retired Pittsburgh firefighter, is moving an old house on Woolfe
Street that’s being displaced by development says he’s doing it to make a
statement.

“It was something that I really wanted to go into because it was something
that’s not done here by black folk,” said Joseph Wicks, who now owns the
house at 33 Woolfe St. “None of the historic revitalization is ever targeted
toward black folk.”

Wicks says he has seen Blacks moved out of downtown neighborhoods
because the development of the tourism in this area caused the increasing of
home prices and made taxes unaffordable for most.

The reason why Wicks bought this house is that it was built in 1840 and it
can’t be torn down!

"Prior to cooking delicious five-star cuisine, celebrity chef Jeff Henderson
cooked something else entirely dangerous—cocaine. As a teenager,
Henderson manufactured and sold drugs in his native home in Los Angeles.
By 19, he was already earning US $35,000 per week. Henderson was later
apprehended and imprisoned for 10 years after one of his men was caught
carrying a big shipment. It was in prison that he discovered his natural flair for
cooking, while he was on kitchen duty.

He was released early for good behavior and soon started working for some
of LA’s top restaurants before venturing into Las Vegas. After experiencing
many rejections due to his felonious past, Henderson finally managed to land
a job at Caesar’s Palace. It was only a matter of time before he finally started
getting recognition and awards, including best Las Vegas Chef in 2001. All
the fame and success hasn’t gotten to Henderson’s head though and he has
continued to share his experiences with at-risk youth to show what they can
achieve in life with the right Choices."

He finally passed the bar exams in Michigan and Washington, DC after
waiting many years to be approved by the respective boards. Afterwards,
Manville worked tirelessly to improve the prison system and represented

Of course, many of you will scoff at comparing 49ers quarterback Colin

in 1966. But after all, Kaepernick is a great athlete who not just sat out the
national anthem in protest, but also gave back to the community by donating
to the Black Youth Project 100.

Kaepernick donated to the Chicago Chapter of the organization toward
“Chapter-specific ideas and endeavors centered on advancing Agenda to
Build Black Futures” which is dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all
Black people in order to improve the lives of black people in the United States
of America.

“I’ll continue to look at other communities in Chicago, as well, as far as what
are ways I can help and what are ways I can try to help empower those
communities,” he said.

When someone strives to uplift the negativity surrounding black people, there
is always someone who will distort the positivity. But we don‘t really care
about haters.

Protest to Stop Police Brutality, Repression and the Criminalization of a

Here in Charlotte, this problem appears especially hard. A number of victims
and quantity of cases, where justice wasn't served - horrifies. The most well-
known case is shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed black man who was
shot ten times and killed. Or situation with Daniel Kevin Harris, a deaf man,
who just couldn't explain a thing, before he was shot.

We need to use our right to protest to demand the authorities and police
representatives, to do, the thing they are supposed to do! To protect and
serve! Not to kill, damage and cripple!

"Everyday we watch, read and receive news of police beating, assaulting, and
killing innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common
that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were
wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,
karma's coming back for blue pigs!

A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police
officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two
officers for seemingly no reason.

The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two
school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza
shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of
police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do |itera||y
nothing without using their guns.

Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their
own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with Chemical and
electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing theirjob."" All those things and
more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my
rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.

Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine
about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is
why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our
ancestors did it for centuries.

Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will Change. Amen."
"The police report that the Black Lives Matter terrorist sniper Micah Johnson

used to buildings owned by Muslim Arabs to carry his attack. If you think it
was just a coincidence, you make a mistake.

Johnson got set up in one building and moved more than 10 miles away to
another building owned by the same people to shoot from. It doesn't look like
it is a coincidence. Moreover, some witnesses said that they saw Jonson
visiting a mosque.

Muslims seem to be not peace-Ioving as they say. And I don't want to see
10,000 potential terrorists here in Texas."
"I was blasting the pokemon theme song from my car, driving to the park to

"After what happened in Dallas ordinary Texans did not remain indifferent.
Several men armed with AR-15 went to the Splendora Police Department and
stood guarding the building. Y’all should do the same thing — we must protect
our cops! We won’t let some gangsters attack the people who keep our
security.

If this is a war against police - we're joining this war on the cop's side!"
"Obama is a total hypocrite and a liar! He visited the Dallas memorial service
to blame us of racism. He just had to turn a ceremony honoring the fallen
officers into a disgraceful. He doesn't care about fallen officers! Obama is not
our leader!

Texans have already honored our heroes, laying flowers at Dallas police
headquarters. But Obama's speech did not make sense at all. That's why we
have to support all police officers who refused to applaud Obama.

Taking sides with these rioters and racists, Obama literally called for open war
against police officers and whites. He came there and he lectured officers
who are targeted every day for assassination by Black Lives Matter that they
need to Change. Kick this asshole out of Texas!"
"Please take a moment to read my story!

Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of
his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the
ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the
location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on

the passenger's side.

When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the
situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man
briefly lying unconscious on the ground.

The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows
that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?

"Clark Dickson, a veteran Seattle police department officer, punched a
homeless 21-year-old man in the head and remained unpunished. The cop
said that his misconduct was “justified” because the man had spit at him.

Almost one year after the incident, the footage showing the punch was
released. Personally, I didn’t notice in the video the suspect spitting at
Dickson. However, the police department didn’t consider it necessary to

punish the cop. The only penalty he got was a suspension without pay for 1
day.

Is it really enough for excessive force use?"

an ""organized crime"" at it's finest, in which we are investing our taxpayers'

Saudi Arabia. Hillary has no remorse about taking money from countries that
abuse the rights of women, while she has always had her own alleged

that prosecute, torture and execute LGBT on the legal basis, although Hillary
has always been a ""defender"" of the minorities.

"A lone sniper shot 14 people and killed 5 police officers, in Dallas late
Thursday night. It was a peaceful protest against the police shootings of Alton
Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights,
Minnesota. So he turned this peaceful protest into a scene of Chaos and
carnage. The wounded include seven police officers and two Civilians. The
sniper, Micah X. Johnson was a black US. military veteran of the Afghan war.
As he was captured, he Claimed he wanted to “kill white people”.

There’s no evidence that he was a Black Lives Matters activist. There’s no
proof that he was into the movement anyhow. It happened almost a week ago
and the police can’t show anything to prove there was a link between Micah
X. Johnson and Black Lives matter. But the Main stream media are telling us
time and again that «black lives matter terrorists are killing the police officers».
The main stream Media are telling us, that the protest against police terror is

And the truth is: a group of people calling their supporters to commit violence
is not a peaceful group. A group of people coming to their opponent’s rallies
and attacking peaceful people is a group of extremists. A group of people
standing behind the attack on police is a group of terrorists. The Black Lives

Recently a huge drug cartel operation was discovered in North Carolina. Over

eight pounds of marijuana, 49.3 grams of heroin, four handguns and $2.5
million in cash, according to a press release. “It would be safe to say that the
money would be taken back to Mexico, and that’s where the source of the
cocaine was,” special agent Tim Stone said.

This is good news, but sadly this operation is just one of the thousands, which
makes it just a slap on the wrist. Our traitor government does nothing to
prevent drug influx, but only trying to create the presence of an effort. The
most part of this poison comes through southern border, but it is still as
unprotected as it possibly can be and drug cartels are abusing it as much as
they can.

gay Club, the reason being that no one knows what goes on inside there even

just know something about other police officer, you keep silence about it. But
if you are in a member of a Club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your
secrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other
cops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the
misconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally
withholding the information about officer misconduct were upper
administrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly
enough, “Sworn officer of the court” is most likely to lie than the Citizen he is
even accusing. So, the lie is a norm for the officers who are keeping the code
of silence, and it’s a miracle if a police officer tells the truth.

A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police
officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two
officers for seemingly no reason.

The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two
school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza
shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of
police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do |itera||y
nothing without using their guns.

Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their
own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with Chemical and
electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing theirjob."" All those things and
more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my
rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.

Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine
about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is
why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our
ancestors did it for centuries.

Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will Change. Amen."

"Please take a moment to read my story!

Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of
his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the
ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the
location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on

the passenger's side.

When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the
situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man
briefly lying unconscious on the ground.

The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows
that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?
Damn, after all that, the only thing I may conclude is DO NOT TALK TO
POLICE! The following video is a prime example of why..."
"We have many problems in our country at the moment. Healthcare, education
and Veterans are just on the top of the list. But one problem is destroying our
country more than anything else. Illegal aliens affect our economy drastically.
Not only they sink the job market and steal hundreds of millions of welfare
dollars, they also flood America with drugs, which is the worst. Mexican
cartels have a stable stream of drugs through the border and our government
does nothing with it.

To cure our nation we need to get rid of all the gangs and illegal immigrants
and build a huge wall so they would never come back!"

So, Bernie has the point. I appreciate the way he maintains his independent
opinion in spite of all the pressure that is on him as the ""second Democratic
option"". Because that is a fact. The Clinton Foundation is nothing more than
an ""organized crime"" at it's finest, in which we are investing our taxpayers'
money!

Hillary has no problem in accepting foreign money from the countries, like
Saudi Arabia. Hillary has no remorse about taking money from countries that
abuse the rights of women, while she has always had her own alleged
feminist stance. She does not refrain from receiving money from the countries
that prosecute, torture and execute LGBT on the legal basis, although Hillary
has always been a ""defender"" of the minorities.

So, why are so many people going to vote for her? That's a secret for me.

"Black people have no place in the coming 2016 presidential election because
we have had our Chance and we never profited out of it. We had a moment to
present economic or social advancement plans to president Obama, yet we
refused and let anti- blacks trick us into thinking that was not elected to
benefit just black people alone. President Obama was elected for a reason.
He was the stepping stone for blacks to rise but it was blown away. Now, it is
the time of White America to rebuild and advance and make their race great.
The war for power between blacks and whites is very real, but the black
community has forgotten. Consequently, the power of black is fading day by
day because those in position are descending from the ladder every day. In
no time, “White Power” will be stronger than before.

That's a fact that US police officers are bad trained. Cops are programmed to
take innocent lives. Cops here in America play God. They believe they are
judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law,

it is theirjob to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot
someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their

eyes.

It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the
difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will

get away with it.

In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand
that theirjob is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,
they understand that they are not the jury and this is not theirjob.

"Mass Shooting At Umpqua Community College In Oregon, 10 Reported Dead

Ten people were killed and seven were wounded Thursday in a shooting at a
small community college in Roseburg, Oregon. The shooting took place in
Classrooms in Snyder Hall.

Law enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man
responsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three
handguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a
fight, because he had body armor and stash of ammunition.

One of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people’s
religions before he began firing.

The hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34,
and quoted a doctor who said that an ""army"" of doctors and nurses had
volunteered to help.

It's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is
the only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few
months. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn’t it time for some
gun control yet?

Some white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported
BLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This
dude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a
few hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's

"All Roads Lead To Washington 00

On October 10, 2015 in Washington, DC, at the National Mall, The
Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan will convene the 20th Anniversary of the
Million Man March under the theme: Justice or Else!

“The Million Man March was one of the most historic organizing and
mobilizing events in the history of Black people in the United States,” said
Chicago—based Dr. Conrad Worrill, who was a main organizer of the March
and the current president emeritus of the National United Black Front.

The widespread death, rising racism, mob attacks and police brutality on
Blacks coupled with economic deprivation and stark poverty, requires that
something must be immediately done to address and correct the condition.
We should stop the violence and the killings and present ourselves as a
united front before the Government of the United States of America. Fredrick
Douglas said “ Power concedes nothing except by a demand”. Our demand
of government must be backed by the power of our unity and love of the
brotherhood.

It's really important for all of us, brothers and sisters.

Join the Movement! 10-10-15
Justice Or Else!"
Welcome everyone to support refugees!
"The leader of radical religious group Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan,
announced that 20th anniversary Million Man March rally will take place on
October 10, 2015 in Washington, DC, at the National Mall. Organizers of the
Million Man March call forjustioe, standing against the police and for blacks,
Latinos and incarcerated.

They say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among
radical groups. Only black activists say “black lives matter”, forgetting the fact
thatjustice is when all lives matter.

Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the
law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes
over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the
immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should
be imprisoned.

Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in
Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan’s
benevolent intentions.

This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim
communities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent
news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal
Robert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on
American extremists to execute him.

There is no problem, if whoever wants to live in the United States. But he
should live here legally; he should not break the law. lt’s justice."

| march to fix a system that houses more black men in our prison system than
there were black men enslaved in 1850. To fix a system that allows for local
prosecutors to investigate their friends at the police department when there is
an officer-involved shooting. To fix a system that has drug laws that
disproportionately arrest black and brown people for using drugs when white
people use at the same rate. To fix a system that has built a private industry
off the backs of prisoners laboring for pennies. To fix a system that doesn't
video record the actions of law enforcement at all times. To fix a system that
criminalizes young women who are pimped and sexually trafficked before
they even turn 18. To fix a system that does not collect any national data on
incidents when police use excessive force or discharge their firearm. To fix a
system that has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world.
To fix a system that has created a school to prison pipeline by harsher school
discipline practices for young students of color. To fix a system of policing that
targets communities of color by programs like ""Stop & Frisk"" or ""Broken
Windows.""

This is why I march. This is why we all should march in order to build a better
future for our kids. We should fight the institutional racism in the country.

"At the Last Supper Jesus says:

He said to them, “But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if

you don’t have a sword, sell your Cloak and buy one.”
— Luke 22:36

What does that mean? Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But

enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always
was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be

followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need
of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would
be exposed to, and of their need of protection.

And we, American Christians, should remember about it. Sometimes you
have to arm yourself to protect your loved ones and friends."

"Native American teens made an interesting journey through their ancestral
lands. The journey was led by Sarah Pemberton member of the Delaware
Nation. Sarah and her partner Kyle Harris created a movie about the journey
called ""The Water Gap: Return to the Homelands"" which already won the
award at the Native American Film Festival of the Southeast.
Propaganda of native culture and traditions is one of most powerful weapons
in Native American fight for their rights. People have always tried to destroy
things they don’t understand. And white people never understood native
culture properly. Many teens who had native ancestors deep in the past know
nothing about their culture. Films, journeys, even videos on Youtube, can

help."
